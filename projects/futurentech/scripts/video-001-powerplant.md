## VIDEO SCRIPT (6-8 minutes)

### HOOK (0:00-0:45)
*[Open with 30 seconds of "Bridge of Sacrifice" title track - the ripping black metal section with blastbeats and screams]*

**VOICEOVER:**
"This is Powerplant. One guy. One bedroom in London. Zero budget.

If you told me this was recorded in a Norwegian forest in 1993, I'd believe you. Frost-bitten drum machines. Eerie screams. Garage-rock guitars slashing through the mix.

But it's 2026. And Theo Zhykharyev did this entire album himself. In his bedroom. For probably less than a thousand dollars.

Here's how he pulled it off."

### THE STORY (0:45-5:00)

**VOICEOVER:**
"Theo Zhykharyev started Powerplant in 2017 after leaving Ukraine to study in London. At first, it was electro-punk. Then dungeon synth. Then hardcore. The guy doesn't stay in one lane.

But his new album, 'Bridge of Sacrifice,' is a full pivot into black metal. And it's the most ambitious thing he's ever done.

Here's what makes it work:

**1. He writes, records, and performs everything himself.**

Guitar. Synths. Vocals. Programming. Everything. When you're a one-person operation, you don't waste time arguing about the direction. You just create.

**2. He embraces lo-fi production on purpose.**

Those tinny drum machines? The frost-bitten sound? That's not a limitation - it's a choice. Early Norwegian black metal from the 90s sounded raw because bands couldn't afford expensive studios. Theo recreates that vibe intentionally with drum machines and garage-rock recording techniques.

**3. He knows how to layer.**

Listen to 'Hall of Wolves' - squalling black metal riffs suddenly break into a camp, Cramps-worthy chorus. Or 'Bridge of Sacrifice' where synth melodies dance around blast beats. This isn't just noise - it's structured chaos.

**4. He mixes genre influences fearlessly.**

Black metal purists might hate this, but Theo doesn't care. He's blending black metal screams with garage rock energy, dungeon synth atmospheres, and even some punk attitude. It's bedroom black metal for people who don't take themselves too seriously.

**5. He runs his own label (Arcane Dynamics).**

No waiting for a label to greenlight your vision. No splitting royalties 80/20. Theo presses his own vinyl, designs his own merch, controls his own destiny. That's how you stay independent AND make money.

**THE TECH ANGLE:**

So how does a bedroom project sound this good?

First: DAW doesn't matter. Theo's probably using something free or cheap like Reaper or GarageBand. What matters is knowing how to use it.

Second: Drum machines are your friend. Real drummers are expensive. Programming blast beats in a DAW costs zero dollars and sounds frost-bitten enough for black metal.

Third: Home recording works if you embrace the aesthetic. Don't try to sound like a $50,000 studio when you're working in a bedroom. Instead, lean into the raw, lo-fi vibe. Black metal fans LOVE that sound.

Fourth: Mix and master smart. Theo got Stanley Gravett to mix and master this. That's the ONE place you might want to spend money - a good mix engineer can take your bedroom recordings and make them sound professional.

Fifth: Do everything else yourself. Artwork? DIY. Merch? Print it yourself. Distribution? Bandcamp takes 15% and you keep the rest. Streaming? Sure, but Bandcamp is where you actually make money.

**WHY IT MATTERS:**

Theo Zhykharyev left Ukraine in 2015. In 2023, he released 'Beautiful Boy' - a ripping punk song about everything lost since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Bridge of Sacrifice isn't just a black metal album. It's a statement. It's escapism. It's Theo fighting back the only way he knows how - by creating something weird, fun, and earnest in the face of chaos.

And he's doing it all himself. No label. No big budget. Just a guy in London with a guitar, a laptop, and the refusal to wait for permission."

Go to ppowerplant.bandcamp.com. Buy the album. Buy a shirt. Support independent music.

Because when you support Theo, you're not funding a label's yacht. You're funding a Ukrainian artist making black metal in his London bedroom.

And that's way cooler.
