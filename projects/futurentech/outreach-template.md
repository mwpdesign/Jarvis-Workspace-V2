**Subject:** FutureNTech - Free Video Feature for Underground Metal

Hi there,

I'm Michael with **FutureNTech** — a YouTube channel spotlighting unsigned and indie metal bands who are making killer music on DIY budgets.

I came across your music on Bandcamp and I'm really impressed. Your sound fits exactly what we're looking for: raw, authentic, and uncompromising.

**What we do:**
- 6-8 minute video features highlighting your band, your story, and your DIY recording process
- Professional narration and production
- **100% free** — no cost to you, no strings attached
- Published to our YouTube channel with links back to your Bandcamp, socials, etc.

**Why we're doing this:**
Too many incredible underground bands get buried in the noise. We want to change that by giving you a platform and amplifying your reach to metalheads who care about real music, not manufactured BS.

**If you're interested:**
Just reply with:
1. A bit about your band (lineup, location, influences, whatever you want to share)
2. Links to your best tracks
3. Any upcoming releases or shows you'd like us to mention

No pressure either way — just wanted to reach out and let you know we're here if you want the exposure.

Keep making heavy music. 🤘

## Notes for Michael

**Customization tips:**
- If you know something specific about the band (recent release, unique sound, etc.), mention it in the opening
- Keep it conversational — we're not a corporation, we're metalheads supporting metalheads
- If they have a specific album or track you really like, name-drop it

**Follow-up:**
- If they respond positively, get their approval on the script before producing the video
- If no response after 7-10 days, one gentle follow-up, then move on

**Tracking:**
- Log each outreach to the Outreach Tracking sheet (Date | Platform | Band | Status)
- Status: "Contacted" → "Interested" / "Declined" / "No Response"
