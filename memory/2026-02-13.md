## Machine Optimization Project

**Created comprehensive optimization guide:** `docs/MACHINE-OPTIMIZATION.md`

**Storage Analysis:**
- M1 Max MacBook Pro: 3.6TB total, 2.2TB free (60% - excellent health)
- Largest consumers: Music 796GB (Logic projects/samples), Movies 43GB, Library 123GB
- Downloads folder pristine at 244KB
- Library hotspots: Application Support 65GB, Containers 28GB, Developer 7.1GB

**Stream Deck Optimization:**
- Designed 4-page layout optimized for actual usage patterns
- Page 1: Core workflow (Logic, Claude, Cursor, Chrome, Telegram, Wispr, Docker, OpenClaw commands)
- Page 2: Secondary apps (Adobe CC, VS Code, Zoom, Slack, Discord)
- Page 3: Automation scripts (OpenClaw ops, Git, Gmail, Calendar, CHP Portal)
- Page 4: Audio production (Logic workflows, plugin management, recording controls)
- Created 7 automation scripts ready to implement (openclaw-restart, git-auto-commit-push, gmail-check, calendar-today, workspace-path, docker-cleanup, logic-new-project)

**Cleanup Recommendations:**
- High priority: Library analysis, email cleanup, Desktop review (1.1GB)
- Medium priority: Music library archival (796GB - archive old Logic projects), Movies folder review
- Monthly: Docker/Homebrew cleanup automation

## OpenClaw Update (Build 2026.2.12 + unreleased 2026.2.13)

**Successfully updated:** d8016c30 → 94763cd8 (170 commits)

**Critical security fixes included:**
- Hook session-routing hardening (fixed unauthenticated webhook exploits)
- Browser control auth requirements (loopback HTTP routes now require auth)
- Sandbox path traversal fixes (skill sync confinement)
- URL-based file handling SSRF protection
- Webhook verification (constant-time secret comparison)
- Session path hardening (rejected unsafe session IDs)
- Nostr profile API remote config tampering fix
- Web tools security (browser/web content treated as untrusted by default)

**Key improvements:**
- Cron reliability fixes (one-shot job re-firing, duplicate fires, scheduler error isolation)
- Session context tracking accuracy (fixed false 100% context usage in `/status`)
- Gateway stability (drain active turns before restart, auto-generate auth token, 5MB WS payload limit)
- Platform-specific fixes for Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord
- New features: `openclaw plugins uninstall`, Discord role-based routing, Telegram `/compact` command

**Impact on our setup:**
- Cron jobs (morning briefing, email monitor, task worker) now more stable
- Session token tracking now accurate
- Security vulnerabilities closed

## Signal Bot Setup (✅ COMPLETE)

**Decision:** Use Signal instead of Telegram for more secure messaging (end-to-end encryption by default)

**Infrastructure installed:**
- ✅ Java 11 already present (OpenJDK 11.0.15)
- ✅ signal-cli 0.13.24 installed via Homebrew
- ✅ Dependencies: openjdk@21, libxext, harfbuzz, little-cms2, gettext

**Bot number:** Google Voice +1 (317) 699-2324 from mwpdesign@gmail.com account

**Current status:** BLOCKED - waiting for fresh CAPTCHA token
- Account created in signal-cli (path: 795321, registered: false)
- CAPTCHA token expired after initial attempt
- Need to complete SMS verification with fresh token from https://signalcaptchas.org/registration/generate.html

**Next steps:**
1. Get fresh CAPTCHA token
2. Complete SMS verification (check Google Voice for 6-digit code)
3. Verify registration with `signal-cli -u +13176992324 verify <code>`
4. Configure OpenClaw Signal channel
5. Start signal-cli daemon
6. Test bot messaging

**Planned OpenClaw Signal config:**
```javascript
{
  channels: {
    signal: {
      enabled: true,
      account: "+13176992324",
      cliPath: "signal-cli",
      dmPolicy: "pairing",
      allowFrom: ["+<Michael's-personal-number>"],
      groupPolicy: "allowlist"
    }
  }
}
```

**Why Signal:**
- ✅ End-to-end encryption (always, not optional like Telegram)
- ✅ No cloud message storage
- ✅ Open source protocol
- ✅ Better privacy (nonprofit Signal Foundation)
- ✅ No data mining

## OpenClaw Web UI Issue (RESOLVED)

**Problem:** Michael tried accessing http://127.0.0.1 and got ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

**Root cause:** OpenClaw web UI runs on port 18789, not default port 80

**Solution:** Correct URL is http://127.0.0.1:18789/

**Status:** Gateway confirmed running and responding (HTTP 200 OK on correct port)

## Work Log Entries

- Created `docs/MACHINE-OPTIMIZATION.md` with Stream Deck layouts, storage analysis, cleanup recommendations
- Updated OpenClaw from d8016c30 → 94763cd8 (170 commits, 2026.2.12 + unreleased 2026.2.13)
- Installed signal-cli 0.13.24 + dependencies for Signal bot
- Initiated Signal registration for +13176992324 (Google Voice number)

---

## Context for Next Session

**Signal setup waiting on:** Fresh CAPTCHA token to complete registration
- Process: Get token from https://signalcaptchas.org/registration/generate.html → run signal-cli register with token → check Google Voice for SMS code → verify code → configure OpenClaw

**Machine optimization pending:** Stream Deck button configuration and automation script creation

**OpenClaw:** Running latest stable release (2026.2.12), web UI accessible at http://127.0.0.1:18789/

## Voice Alert System - FINAL CONFIGURATION ✅

**Status:** OPERATIONAL (Signal-only, no phone calls)

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Signal bot fully configured (+1 317-699-2324 via Google Voice/mwpdesign@gmail.com)
- ✅ ElevenLabs voice generation (FutureNTech voice clone, 1.2x speed for natural sound)
- ✅ Signal text notifications delivering to Michael's phone
- ✅ Voice files generating perfectly (saved locally for reference)

**Architecture Decision:**
- **Rejected:** Twilio phone calling (trial "press any key" prompt = poor UX, too complex)
- **Chose:** Signal text notifications (instant, simple, free, works perfectly)
- **Result:** Clean, simple workflow - generate voice with ElevenLabs, send text via Signal

**Twilio Status:**
- Account canceled (2026-02-13)
- Phone number released (+1 317-342-0606)
- Stopped $1.15/month recurring charge
- **Reason:** Unnecessary complexity, Signal handles everything we need

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/jarvis-voice-alert.js` - ElevenLabs + Signal integration (Node.js)
- `scripts/voice-alert.sh` - Bash wrapper for voice alerts
- `docs/VOICE-ALERTS.md` - Complete workflow documentation
- `docs/TWILIO-CALLING.md` - Documentation (historical reference)

**How It Works:**
1. Generate voice with ElevenLabs (FutureNTech voice, 1.2x speed)
2. Send text notification via Signal
3. Michael's phone buzzes with Signal notification
4. Message delivered instantly

**Cost Per Alert:**
- ElevenLabs: ~800 credits per voice message
- Signal: FREE
- Total: ~800 ElevenLabs credits (90,000 remaining = ~112 alerts available)

**Integration Points:**
- Can be called from OpenClaw sessions
- Can be automated via cron jobs
- Can be triggered manually via CLI

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate with morning briefing workflow
- Add to urgent alert system
- Connect to task reminder system
