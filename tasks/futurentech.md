# FutureNTech Tasks

## URGENT - Needed for Outreach

### Mike, I need you to do these 3 things so I can start outreach:

**1. Set up Reddit account access for me**
- Go to: https://www.reddit.com/settings/apps
- Create a new app (type: script)
- Give me the client ID and client secret
- **WHY:** I need to post comments on 3 band posts (Usury, Mantera Anarchist, Volubilis)
- **TIME:** 5 minutes

**2. Set up Instagram access for me**
- Option A: Give me login credentials (username/password)
- Option B: Generate an app password
- **WHY:** I need to DM 3 bands (thistle., dead things, Void)
- **TIME:** 2 minutes

**3. OR: Let me use Bandcamp contact forms**
- If you can't do #1 and #2 right now, just say "use Bandcamp"
- I'll message bands through their Bandcamp pages
- Slower response rate but I can do it immediately
- **TIME:** I start now

---

## What happens after you choose:

**If you give me Reddit/Instagram access:**
- I post personalized messages to all 6 bands within 30 minutes
- I update the tracking sheet as I go
- You see progress in real-time

**If you say "use Bandcamp":**
- I find contact forms on their pages
- I send messages now (may take longer to get replies)
- We set up social accounts later for future outreach

---

**TELL ME:** Which option? #1+#2, or #3?
