## 📅 RECOMMENDED SHOOTING ORDER

### **Week 1: Performance (Warehouse)**
**Day 1-2**: Prep, location scout, gather gear  
**Day 3-5**: WAREHOUSE - Shoot all performance + warehouse narrative (Shots W1-W19)

**Why First**: 
- Hardest to schedule (need all band members)
- Most important footage (performance proves you're a real band)
- Get it done while energy is high

### **Week 2: Narrative (Attic + Outdoors)**
**Day 1-2**: ATTIC - All investigation/discovery scenes (Shots A1-A11)  
**Day 3**: OUTDOORS (Golden Hour) - First impression & suspicious behavior (Shots O1-O9)

**Day 2**: OUTDOORS (Golden Hour) - Aftermath/resolution scenes (Shots O10-O19)

## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR LOCATION SHOOTING

### Warehouse:
- **Arrive early** - set up lights, test angles
- **Shoot wide coverage first** - get establishing shots
- **Then move to close-ups** - easier to light/frame
- **Keep instruments in tune** - check between takes
- **Sync method**: Have someone clap on camera at start of each take (makes editing easier)

### Attic:
- **Check natural light timing** - shoot during best window light
- **Use dust/atmosphere** - If attic is dusty, use it! (looks great with light)
- **Rehearse movements** - tight space, plan before shooting
- **Sound doesn't matter** - music will cover it

### Outdoors:
- **Golden hour is critical** - timing is everything
- **Scout ahead** - find best angles/backgrounds before actors arrive
- **Have backup date** - weather can ruin outdoor shoots
- **Shoot more than needed** - "magic hour" is short, maximize it

### Bottle Smash:
- **Safety first** - designated smash zone, everyone wears shoes
- **Multiple angles** - set up 2+ phones if possible
- **Slow-motion** - 120fps minimum, 240fps better
- **Practice throw** - do dry runs without bottle to nail the angle

## ✅ PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

1. **Print this shooting schedule**
2. **Check off shots as you complete them**
3. **Review footage at end of each location day** (make sure you got it!)
4. **Reshoot anything questionable** while you're still at location
5. **Move to next location** only when confident
