# 2026-01-30 - Daily Memory

## Summary
New day started.

## Tasks & Activities
- **Credit card statement organization project**: Downloading all 2025 statements to ~/Desktop/Statements/ folders
  - Completed: Costco Citi (all statements)
  - In progress: Prime Store Card (3/10 downloaded: Jan, Dec, Nov 2025)
  - Remaining cards: Guitar Center, Sweetwater, CareCredit, and others in folder structure
- User cleared Downloads folder to make batch downloads cleaner

## Conversations & Context
- **Evening conversation about residual income**: Michael asked for ways to generate extra money that I can manage (he's too busy with work)
- **YouTube channel decision**: Agreed to launch AI-generated music discovery channel
- **Song lyric work**: Helped format "Wild Little Psycho" lyrics for Suno AI (added bridge section)
- **Voice clone recording**: Michael recorded 5-min voice sample for AI voice cloning

## Decisions Made
- **MAJOR: Launching "FutureNTech" YouTube Channel (already registered @FutureNTech)**
  - Format: Music discovery + AI/tech angle (70% artist features, 20% tech tools, 10% industry trends)
  - Division of labor: Jarvis handles 100% production (research, scripting, voice generation, editing, posting, outreach), Michael approves scripts (10-15 min/week)
  - Revenue model: Ad revenue + affiliates + eventual band sponsorships
  - Timeline: 12-month commitment before expecting significant income
  - Target: $1-3k/month passive income by month 12
  - Content source: Band submissions via Google Form + outreach to Reddit/Facebook/Bandcamp
  - Michael leverages his band network for initial submissions
  - Voice: Using Michael's AI voice clone for narration
  - Weekend action: Create test video, submission form, first 3 scripts


## Notes & Observations
- **Late night deep dive**: Michael and I spent 2+ hours strategizing the YouTube channel
- **Research completed**: Analyzed successful music discovery channels (COLORS, NPR Tiny Desk, etc.)
- **Competitive advantage identified**: We're combining music discovery + tech/strategy angle (nobody else doing this)
- **Michael's insight**: Leverage his band network for initial submissions, build circular growth engine
- **Philosophy established**: "We're the gateway, not the destination" - always link to artists, help them grow
- **Project infrastructure created**: Full project file in `projects/futurentech/`, added to HEARTBEAT.md monitoring
- **Channel already exists**: FutureNTech (@FutureNTech) with YouTube Premium, profile pic set
- **Weekend action plan locked in**: Voice clone test, scripts, submission form, outreach templates
