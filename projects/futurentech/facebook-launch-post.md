### POST TEXT:

**Calling all my band friends 🎸🔥**

I'm launching a YouTube channel to spotlight unsigned rock and metal artists — **and I want YOUR band considered for a feature video.**

**FutureNTech** isn't another playlist. It's full video features that showcase your music AND your story: how you're building your career, what tech you're using, what's working for you. Real exposure to thousands of rock/metal fans.

**🎯 SUBMIT YOUR BAND HERE:** http://bit.ly/3Mm5rdN

It's 100% free. No strings. Just genuine exposure for artists who are grinding their way up.

**If you're not in a band but know someone who is** — share this with them. Especially if they're:
- Unsigned or independent
- Rock, metal, hardcore, punk, anything heavy
- Building a fanbase the DIY way
- Deserve way more attention than they're getting

**ALSO:** If you just want to support the channel, subscribe early → **youtube.com/@FutureNTech**

Early subscribers help the algorithm push the channel to more people. More reach = more bands get discovered.

**First video drops soon.** Let's build something that actually helps underground artists get heard.

— Michael

## 📱 POSTING STRATEGY

### When to Post:
**Best times for band engagement:**
- **Tuesday-Thursday, 7-9 PM** (after work, before bed scrolling)
- **Sunday afternoon, 2-5 PM** (weekend chill time)

### How to Post:
1. **Upload image first** (visual grabs attention)
2. **Paste text** (keep it in your voice)
3. **Tag relevant friends** who are in bands (do this in comments, not post)
4. **Use hashtags:**
   - #UnsignedArtist #RockMusic #MetalMusic #IndependentMusic #NewYouTubeChannel

### Engagement Hack:
**Comment on your own post immediately:**
> "Already got submissions from [Band Name] and [Band Name] — stoked to feature some killer underground talent. Who else should I check out?"

This:
- Keeps the post active (algorithm boost)
- Shows social proof (submissions already coming)
- Encourages others to submit

---

## 🚀 SHARE STRATEGY

### Ask Band Friends to Share:
Send DM to close band friends:
> "Hey man, launching a YouTube channel to feature unsigned bands. Just posted about it on FB — would mean a lot if you could share it. Also submit your band if you want a feature video: http://bit.ly/3Mm5rdN"

### Create Shareable Story Post:
Instagram/FB story:
- Screenshot the submission form
- Text overlay: "Submit your band → FutureNTech"
- Swipe-up link (if available) or "Link in bio"
