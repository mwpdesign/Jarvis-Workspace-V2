- **Status:** ✅ APPROVED by Michael ("That's the one")
- **Date:** January 31, 2026

**Use This For:**
- Reference quality for future videos
- A/B testing if we need to regenerate
- Backup of approved voice settings
- Comparison if voice quality ever changes

**Production Settings (ElevenLabs):**
- Voice Name: FutureNTech
- Model: Eleven Multilingual v2
- Speed: 1.0 (100%)
- Stability: 50%
- Similarity: Default
- Style Exaggeration: 0%
- Speaker Boost: ON (75%)

**Note:** This is the sweet spot after testing multiple models and settings. v3 was too slow, earlier v2 attempts were too rushed. These default v2 settings produce natural pacing with proper breathing.
