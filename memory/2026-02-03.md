# 2026-02-03

## Daily Auto-Update (4:00 AM)
- **OpenClaw**: Already current (v2026.1.30)
- **Skills Checked**: 7 total
  - ✅ All up to date: auto-updater (1.0.0), claude-code-wingman (0.3.0), youtube-watcher (1.0.0), humanizer (1.0.0), gemini-deep-research (1.0.0), nano-banana-pro (1.0.1)
  - 📝 self-improving-agent: Local changes (working skill - expected)
- **Status**: No updates needed, all systems current

## Morning Briefing (7:00 AM)
- Weather: Partly cloudy, ~32°F Indianapolis
- No urgent emails overnight
- War room research: Wound care trends (Manuka honey, advanced closure tech $32.5B by 2035), FDA MolecuLightDX qualified as MDDT, ConvaTec emerging competitor
- Daily lyric seed: "Hollow Crown" (weight of reluctant leadership)

## Self-Improvement System Activated (7:05 AM)
- Michael asked "Are you self-learning and improving every day?"
- Activated self-improving-agent skill (should have been using all along)
- Created .learnings/ directory with ERRORS.md, LEARNINGS.md, FEATURE_REQUESTS.md
- First error logged: ERR-20260203-001 (directory read error from morning briefing)
- First learning logged: LRN-20260203-001 (need to use self-improvement consistently)
- **Commitment:** Log errors immediately, capture corrections, document better approaches

## Cost Optimization Decision (7:09 AM)
- Michael asked about heartbeat costs ($18/month for Sonnet heartbeats)
- Researched switching to Haiku (would save $16.50/month)
- Attempted migration but hit "model not allowed" error (isolated sessions have restricted allowlist)
- **DECISION:** Keep Sonnet for everything - simplicity over optimization
- Logged as LRN-20260203-002: Complexity isn't worth $19/month savings
- Matches Michael's "vibe coding" philosophy: pragmatic over perfect

## Rate Limit Issues Resolved (6:30 AM)
- Morning briefing cron at 6:30 AM was hitting Brave API rate limits (1 search/second)
- Problem: Both heartbeat (2-6 AM searches) AND 6:30 AM cron firing searches
- **SOLUTION:** Disabled 6:30 AM "Morning Briefing" cron (was duplicate anyway)
- Kept 7:00 AM "Jarvis Daily Briefing" cron
- Heartbeat now handles overnight searches (spread across 2-6 AM as designed)

## FutureNTech Channel Branding Complete (8:48-9:01 AM)

### Issue: Original banner lacked wow factor
- First banner (v1) looked bland, no impact
- Created multiple variations testing different styles
- **v2:** Concert scene with dramatic lighting (19MB, 4K)
- **v3:** Modern minimalist geometric design (15MB)
- **v4-v8:** Heavy industrial metal variations

### Key insight: Profile pic colors didn't match banner
- Profile pic = electric blue/cyan circuits
- Early banners = all orange/red fire
- **Solution:** Created v10 with blue circuits + orange fire together
- Result: Unified brand aesthetic

### Safe zone issues caught early
- YouTube banner safe zones matter - gears getting cut off
- Created centered compositions (v9, v10)
- Everything important fits in viewable area

### Final result
- **Banner v10:** Blue circuits + orange fire, industrial metal aesthetic, centered
- **Profile pic:** Electric blue FN logo with circuits
- **Watermark:** 150x150 FN logo for video corner
- **Channel looks professional with ZERO videos**

## Setting Up Autonomous Outreach (10:00-11:30 AM)

### Challenge: Need social media access
- I can't post to Reddit/Instagram without credentials
- Bandcamp pages don't show public emails
- Can't start outreach without access

### Michael's directive (11:19 AM)
> "This is your project, you need to give me explicit instructions on what you need to do. If something needs to be done, make sure it's on the list of things I need you to do."

**Lesson learned:** Be direct about blockers, create clear task lists

### Solution: Dedicated FutureNTech Reddit Account
- Better than using Michael's personal account
- Posts come from "FutureNTech" (professional branding)
- Email: futurentechofficial@gmail.com
- **In progress:** Michael creating account + API credentials now (11:20-11:31 AM)

### What I need to start outreach
1. Reddit API credentials (client ID, client secret, username, password)
2. Instagram login access (for DMs)
3. **OR** alternative: Use Bandcamp contact forms

### Files Created
- `tasks/futurentech.md` - Clear prerequisites for outreach
- Made expectations explicit

---

## Telegram API Issues (10:35-11:05 AM)

### Symptoms
- HTTP 500 errors during heartbeats (10:35, 10:40, 10:45, 10:50 AM)
- "Internal server error" from Telegram API

### Diagnosis
- Checked Downdetector: No major Telegram outage
- Errors = temporary Telegram API hiccups (server-side)
- Self-resolved after ~15 minutes

### Action taken
- Explained to Michael it's normal, Telegram-side issue
- No restart needed
- Monitoring continues

## Key Learnings Today

1. **Branding matters:** Took multiple iterations to get banner right, but final result is professional
2. **Color cohesion critical:** Profile pic and banner must match aesthetically
3. **Be explicit about blockers:** Don't assume - state exactly what you need
4. **Create clear task lists:** When blocked, document prerequisites clearly
5. **Dedicated accounts > personal:** FutureNTech Reddit account is better branding
