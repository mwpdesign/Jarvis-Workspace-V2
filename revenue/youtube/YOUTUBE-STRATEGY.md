## 🎤 Script Template (First Video)

### Video Title: "How I Automated My Email with AI (Saves 10 Hours/Week)"

**INTRO (0:00-0:20)**

> [Face camera, energetic]
> "I haven't manually sorted my email in six months. This AI workflow automatically triages everything, flags urgent messages, and even drafts replies. I'm Michael, a Solutions Architect who automates everything, and today I'm going to show you exactly how I built this - for free."

**SECTION 1: The Problem (0:20-1:30)**

> [Screen recording of messy inbox]
> "Here's the thing - I get about 200 emails a day between my work account and personal. That's over 1000 emails per week. Before automation, I was spending 2 hours every single day just sorting through this mess. That's 10 hours per week. 40 hours per month. That's insane."

> [Cut to face]
> "So I built an AI system using n8n and Claude that does it for me. And you can too. Here's how..."

**SECTION 2: The Solution Overview (1:30-3:00)**

> [Diagram/workflow visualization]
> "The system has three parts: Email monitoring, AI analysis, and smart routing. n8n watches my inbox every 5 minutes, Claude AI reads each message and categorizes it, then it automatically labels, archives, or flags it based on importance."

> [Show workflow]
> "Here's what the actual n8n workflow looks like..." [walk through nodes]

**SECTION 3: Build It With Me (3:00-7:00)**

> [Step-by-step tutorial]
> "Let's build this together. First, create a free n8n account... [tutorial steps]"

**SECTION 4: Results & Benefits (7:00-8:30)**

> [Show results dashboard]
> "In the past 6 months, this system has processed over 48,000 emails. It correctly categorized 97% of them. I only manually check my 'Important' folder once a day, which takes about 10 minutes instead of 2 hours."

> [Face camera]
> "That's 10 hours back in my life every week. Time I now spend on things that actually matter - like making music with my band, or building cool projects, or... making YouTube videos like this one."

**OUTRO (8:30-9:00)**

> "If you want the full n8n workflow template, I've put a link in the description. It's completely free. And if you found this helpful, drop a like and subscribe - I post weekly videos on AI automation, audio engineering, and what I call 'vibe coding.' Next week I'm showing you my $10K home studio and what I'd actually buy again. See you then."
