## Telegram Forum Topic Configuration (11:45 AM)

**Issue Discovered:** OpenClaw not correctly detecting which Telegram forum topic messages come from
- Messages sent from "Scripts" topic show as topic:16 instead of topic:17
- Telegram forum `message_thread_id` not being parsed correctly by OpenClaw plugin

**Action Taken:**
- Updated config: Set `requireMention: false` for Jarvis-FutureNTech group (-1003703487338)
- Now responds to all Michael's messages in that group, regardless of topic
- Gateway restarted successfully

**Workaround Impact:**
- ✅ Jarvis responds to all messages (no mention needed)
- ❌ Can't distinguish which topic thread for topic-specific behavior
- 📝 All messages appear as "topic:16" internally

**Michael's Directive:**
"Make sure you're self-improving always trying to find ways to fix things when we don't have things working the way that we would like them"

**Follow-up Actions:**
- Created `memory/known-issues.md` to track this and future issues
- Will monitor OpenClaw updates for forum topic detection improvements
- Set reminder to test after each OpenClaw update

**Key Learning:** Don't just accept workarounds - always document issues and actively seek proper solutions. Self-improvement means continuously monitoring for better ways to do things.
