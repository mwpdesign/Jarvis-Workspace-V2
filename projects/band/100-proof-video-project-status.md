## 📋 PROJECT SUMMARY

**Goal**: Create 6x30-second serialized Instagram Reels/TikToks that combine into a full music video for "100 Proof"

## ✅ COMPLETED WORK

### 1. Complete 6-Reel Video Storyboard
**File**: `projects/band/100-proof-video-storyboard.md`

**What It Includes**:
- Shot-by-shot breakdown for each 30-second reel
- Narrative arc across all 6 reels (meeting → suspicion → investigation → confrontation → revelation → aftermath)
- Performance + narrative integration for each section

- Cinematography notes (color grading, camera techniques)
- Instagram posting strategy (captions, hashtags, release schedule)
- Phone shooting pro tips
- Editing software recommendations
- 3-week production schedule overview

**Key Creative Elements**:
- **Reel 1**: First impression - everything seems perfect (0-30s)
- **Reel 2**: Mask begins to slip - small inconsistencies (30-60s)
- **Reel 3**: Digging deeper - investigation, finding clues (61-93s)
- **Reel 4**: Confrontation building - realization hits (93-112s)
- **Reel 5**: The revelation - truth revealed, bottle shatters (112-164s)
- **Reel 6**: Aftermath & resolution - moving forward (164-244s)

### 2. Location-Based Shooting Schedule
**File**: `projects/band/100-proof-shooting-schedule.md`

**What It Includes**:
- Organized by LOCATION, not reel sequence (smart production efficiency)
- 54 total shots across 5 location visits
- Complete shot lists for each location with checkboxes
- Gear requirements for each location
- People needed for each shoot
- Time estimates
- Safety protocols (bottle smash)
- Pro tips for each location type

**Location Breakdown**:
- **Warehouse**: 19 shots (all performance + confrontation scene)
- **Attic**: 11 shots (investigation/discovery scenes)
- **Outdoors Day 1**: 9 shots (first meeting, suspicious behavior)
- **Outdoors Day 2**: 10 shots (emotional aftermath, resolution)
- **Bottle Smash**: 5 shots (slow-mo special effects)

**Efficiency Win**: Cut location trips from 10 → 5 (50% time savings)

## ⏳ PENDING / NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Before Shooting Starts):
1. **Present to band** - Get everyone's input and approval
2. **Assign narrative roles** - Who plays which character in story scenes?
3. **Band feedback** - Modify storyboard based on their ideas
4. **Scout locations** - Take reference photos at warehouse, attic, outdoor spots
5. **Gather props** - Most importantly: "100 Proof" liquor bottle(s)
6. **Schedule production days** - Get everyone's availability

### Production Phase (When Ready):
1. **Week 1**: Shoot all warehouse performance + narrative scenes
2. **Week 2**: Shoot attic investigation scenes + outdoor golden hour shots
3. **Week 3**: Shoot bottle smash + final outdoor shots + EDIT all reels

### Release Phase:
1. Post Reel 1 (start building anticipation)
2. Post Reels 2-5 every 2-3 days
3. Post Reel 6 + full music video release

## 🎨 CREATIVE VISION SUMMARY

### Visual Metaphors:
- **"100 Proof" bottle**: Represents the lie/facade, shatters when truth revealed
- **Light progression**: Warm → cool → muted warm (false comfort → harsh truth → acceptance)
- **Warehouse**: Confinement/past (performance happens here, walking away = freedom)
- **Eyes**: Reel 1 = trusting/open, Reel 6 = wiser/guarded but strong

### Style Notes:
- Mix of performance (proves you're a real band) + narrative (engages emotionally)
- Phone-shot aesthetic (raw, authentic, DIY friendly)
- Serialized release (builds anticipation, algorithm-friendly)
- Each reel tells part of story, final reel combines into full video

---

## 💡 KEY DECISIONS MADE

1. ✅ **Serialized format** - 6 reels build to full video (vs. one long video)
2. ✅ **Location-based shooting** - Shoot all warehouse shots at once (vs. going back multiple times)
3. ✅ **Performance + narrative mix** - Show band playing + tell story (vs. performance-only or narrative-only)
4. ✅ **Phone cameras** - Accessible, DIY, authentic (vs. hiring videographer)
5. ✅ **Theme clarity** - "Not being 100% with you" / hidden secrets (relatable, emotional)
6. ✅ **3-week timeline** - Realistic for band schedule (vs. rushed or dragged out)

---

## 🔄 POTENTIAL MODIFICATIONS (Based on Band Feedback)

**If band wants to change**:
- Narrative storyline (different theme/concept)
- Performance locations (different warehouse/venue)
- Timeline (shorter/longer production)
- Budget (add/reduce spending)
- Roles (who appears in narrative scenes)
- Visual style (color grading, editing approach)

**Easy to modify** because:
- All files are organized and documented
- Shot lists can be adjusted
- Location schedule is flexible
- Core structure (6 reels) is sound

---

## 📊 PRODUCTION STATS

- **Total Shots**: 54
- **Total Locations**: 3 (warehouse, attic, outdoors)
- **Total Location Visits**: 5 (efficiency optimized)
- **Production Days**: ~7 days shooting + 5-7 days editing
- **People Needed**: Full band + 1-2 actors for narrative
- **Budget**: $55-85
- **Final Output**: 6 Instagram Reels + 1 full music video (4 min 4 sec)

---

## 🎤 BAND INPUT NEEDED

When presenting to the band, ask:
1. **Overall concept** - Do they like the "hidden secrets" theme?
2. **Narrative roles** - Who wants to act in the story scenes?
3. **Location access** - Can everyone get to warehouse/attic locations?
4. **Timeline** - When can everyone commit to 2-3 shooting days?
5. **Creative input** - Any ideas to add/change?
6. **Comfort level** - Everyone okay with phone-shot DIY approach?

---

## 🚀 WHY THIS WILL WORK

1. **Serialized = Engagement** - TikTok/Instagram algorithm loves series content
2. **Story = Emotional Connection** - People invest in narrative, want to see what happens
3. **Performance = Credibility** - Shows you're a real band, not just actors
4. **DIY Aesthetic = Authentic** - Raw, real, relatable (not over-produced)
5. **Efficiency = Achievable** - Location-based shooting makes it doable in 3 weeks
6. **6 Viral Opportunities** - Each reel can blow up independently
