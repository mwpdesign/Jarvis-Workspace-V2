Hey! Just listened to your track from *1913* - that heavy guitar work is killer! The 90s/2000s alt-rock vibe totally comes through.

I run FutureNTech on YouTube - we feature unsigned rock/metal artists and break down how they're building their careers (DIY recording, tech, social strategy, etc.). Your Spotify numbers show you're doing something right, and I'd love to showcase you guys.

We're launching the channel now and looking for our first features. Interested? Would get your music in front of thousands of rock fans + share your story.

No cost, no strings - just exposure. If you're down, drop your info here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1uiD8vWmX_AQnNdfVxDI1Ft2yN5HBR_R2MKF8KnWkoTk/viewform

Or reply here if you have questions! 🤘

Dude, "Whatever" hits HARD. That emotional numbness vibe with the grunge aesthetic is exactly what the underground needs right now.

"Haunted thrash metal" - now THAT'S a concept! The Vlad the Impaler story behind *Forbidden Morals* is sick.
