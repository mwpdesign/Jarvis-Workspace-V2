> "Here is the weekly report for 1/19-1/23. Since the foundations are in place now, at the end of this week I will do a review with the team to cross-reference where we are in relation to the scope of work documents and let you if we are on track, ahead, or behind."

## 🔍 What This Report Should Contain

Based on Henry's updates, the report likely covers:

**Week of January 19-23, 2026 (Sprint 1)**:
- Developer ramp-up progress
- Local environment setup
- Codebase familiarization
- Sprint documentation in ClickUp
- Foundation work completion
- Any blockers or issues encountered

---

## ⏰ Follow-Up Actions

**This Week**:
- [ ] Download and review the PDF report
- [ ] Note any concerns or questions
- [ ] Ask Henry about specific details if needed
- [ ] **End of week**: Get results of SOW cross-reference review

**Questions to Ask After Reviewing**:
1. What does "foundations are in place" specifically mean?
2. Which database models are complete?
3. Which backend services are implemented?
4. Are any frontend components ready for testing?
5. When will full Sprint 1 be delivered to staging?

---

## 📊 Expected Timeline

**Sprint 1** was Weeks 1-2 (approximately Jan 6-17 based on Dec 30 start date)

**Current Status** (as of Jan 26):
- Foundation work complete
- SOW review scheduled for end of this week
- Full Sprint 1 delivery to staging: TBD

**This suggests**: Sprint 1 may have taken longer than 2 weeks, OR foundation work is subset of Sprint 1, and full delivery is coming soon

**Question for Henry**: Is Sprint 1 complete or is foundation work just the first phase?
