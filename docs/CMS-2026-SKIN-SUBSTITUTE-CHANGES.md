## Strategic Implications for Clear Health Pass

### Immediate Concerns
1. **Revenue Impact:** 90% payment cut affects all competitors equally
2. **Market Consolidation:** Expect smaller players to exit market
3. **Product Positioning:** Quality/efficacy now matters more than ever (price is standardized)

### Opportunities
1. **Clinical Differentiation:** Strong clinical data becomes THE competitive advantage
2. **Larger Wounds:** HOPD payment improvements favor our products for complex cases
3. **Early Adaptation:** Companies that adapt quickly will capture displaced market share

### Action Items
- [ ] Review pricing strategy in light of standardized reimbursement
- [ ] Emphasize clinical outcomes data in sales materials
- [ ] Target hospital outpatient departments (improved payment for larger wounds)
- [ ] Monitor competitor responses (bankruptcies, exits, pivots)
