## n8n Workflow Cleanup (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** 10 Jarvis-created agent workflows failing continuously, burning API costs
**Root cause:** Workflows used `child_process` module (shell commands) - disallowed on n8n cloud
**Action taken:** All 10 workflows archived (not deleted):
- Mission Control - Jarvis Hub v2
- Deep Research - Overnight Reports
- Context Loader - Project Tracker
- Opportunity Scanner - Business Intelligence
- Calendar Intelligence - Meeting Prep
- AI Intelligence Feed - Tech Monitor
- Self-Improvement Logger - Error Tracker
- State Awareness - Context Reader
- Pattern Analyzer - Workflow Intelligence
- Knowledge Gap Tracker - Learn & Fill

**Lesson learned:** n8n cloud blocks shell/process execution - cannot run agent workflows needing system access
**Future approach:** Run agents via heartbeat (already working for email monitoring), use n8n only for HTTP/webhook tasks

**Documented in:** MEMORY.md

## Email Acknowledgment System (NEW PROJECT)

**Client:** Clear Health Pass (CHP) - mike@clearhealthpass.com
**Goal:** Auto-acknowledge emails in 4 labeled inboxes (Orders, Onboarding, IVRs, Intake)
**Team request:** Kenya/Tiffany/Phil tired of senders not knowing if emails were received

**Architecture designed:**
- n8n workflow (always-on, runs even when laptop closed)
- Gmail Trigger → Filter automated senders → Create Draft Reply → Log to Google Sheet
- Gmail drafts (NOT auto-send) - manual review/send for testing phase
- Loop prevention: Skip noreply@, no-reply@, mailer-daemon@, postmaster@, donotreply@

**Implementation status:**
- ✅ Workflow created in n8n: "Email Acknowledgment - Orders (TEST)" (ID: XLDD5Ng6O2QUhT8f)
- ✅ Design doc: automation/email-acknowledgments.md
- ⏳ Needs Gmail OAuth credentials (sound-bit-485500-u5 project)
- ⏳ Google Sheet for logging not yet created
- ⏳ 3 more workflows needed (IVRs, Intake, Onboarding)

**Gmail labels:**
- Orders: Label_4616328338066571363
- IVRs: Label_5885609014616052807
- Intake: Label_6503716778660195852
- Onboarding: Label_5051430237326897767

**Next steps:**
1. ✅ Michael created Gmail OAuth credential "Clearhealthpass" in n8n
2. ⏸️ **PAUSED 13:47 EST** - Stuck on OAuth redirect URI mismatch error
3. **Resume here:** Add redirect URI to Google Cloud (sound-bit-485500-u5 project):
   - Authorized redirect URIs → Add: `https://n8n.srv1055324.hstgr.cloud/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`
4. Complete OAuth sign-in with mike@clearhealthpass.com
5. Update workflow nodes to use "Clearhealthpass" credential
6. Test Orders workflow with real email
7. Create Google Sheet for logging
8. Duplicate for other 3 labels
9. Add hourly alert when drafts are waiting

**File updated:** automation/email-acknowledgments.md (setup status section added)

## API Cost Audit (PROACTIVE)

**Trigger:** Michael concerned about rate limiting and runaway API costs after n8n failures
**Action:** Created HEARTBEAT-API-AUDIT.md documenting:
- Current API usage: War room searches (240-300/month), Weather (30/month)
- Proposed limits: AI updates 3x daily (9 AM, 2 PM, 7 PM) = 6 searches/day
- Total monthly budget: ~450-510 searches (well under 2,000 Brave API limit)
- 3-strike protection: Stop calling API for 24h if rate limited 3x in a row

**Recommendation:** Update HEARTBEAT.md with explicit API call schedules (not "random timing")

## Tasks Completed

1. ✅ **Smart Sheets video** - Michael edited and uploaded to Drive for Tiffany/Kenya (KANBAN updated)
2. ✅ **Henry Campbell questions** - Answered via Claude Desktop (marked complete in KANBAN)

**Tasks added:**
- Instructional Guide #1: Onboarding checklist (distributors, sales reps, doctors)
- Instructional Guide #2: Patient-level checks (detailed patient verification)

## Fact-Checking

**TikTok claim:** "IRS 30% auditors quit, Donald Trump making change to SSI/SSDI"
**Verdict:** Partially true, exaggerated
- ✅ IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel resigned (Jan 2025)
- ✅ 20,000+ IRS employees accepted buyout offers
- ✅ ~7,000 layoffs announced
- ✅ Trump admin proposed SSI/SSDI cuts (not finalized)
- ❌ "30% of auditors quit" - NOT verified in legitimate news sources
**Classic social media tactic:** Mix real story + shocking fake number = viral misinformation

## Henry Campbell Questions (CHP Woundcare)

**Found on Desktop:** "Questions for New Services Implementation.docx"

**WoundGraft ZIP Import Service:**
- Needs sample manifest.json structure
- How to map photo files to 12 document types?
- Duplicate detection: patient + treatment date only?
- Handle extra/missing files: block or allow with warning?
- Sample ZIP file for testing?

**IVR Validation Service:**
- Which of 6 required documents are "foundational" (block submission if missing)?

**Status:** Michael answered via Claude Desktop (marked complete)

## Video Editing Request

**Location:** Desktop/Work/Video/
- Phil Smartsheets.mov (185MB)
- Phil Smartsheets 2.mov (217MB)
**Task:** Merge both + cut sections
**Options suggested:** iMovie (easiest), ffmpeg (I do it), Final Cut Pro
**Status:** Not started (Michael working on it)

---

## Key Learnings

1. **n8n cloud limitations:** No shell commands, no child_process - only HTTP/API calls
2. **Always-on automation:** n8n workflows solve laptop-closed problem (heartbeat doesn't)
3. **Test before auto-send:** Draft replies first, manual review, then automate
4. **Cost awareness:** Michael values cost-effective solutions - audit API usage proactively
5. **Voice capture works:** Michael using Wispr Flow → Telegram successfully ("todo not doodle")

## Technical Context

**n8n instance:** https://n8n.srv1055324.hstgr.cloud
**Google OAuth project:** sound-bit-485500-u5 (External, Testing mode)
