## Competitive Analysis

### What's Working (Successful Channels):

**COLORS (8M subs, 40M views/month):**
- Simple, consistent format
- Minimalist aesthetic
- Artist-first approach
- "All colors, no genres" motto

**NPR Tiny Desk, Audiotree, SOFAR Sounds:**
- Live performance + artist story
- Professional but intimate
- Discovery + context

### Our Differentiator:

**Others show performances** → We show performances + HOW they got there  
**Others feature music** → We feature music + the STRATEGY behind growth  
**They're passive discovery** → We're ACTIVE learning (musicians watch to learn)
