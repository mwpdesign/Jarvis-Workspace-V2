## Patterns Observed

### 2026-01-25
- **Setup Day**: Full Jarvis configuration and optimization
- **Tools Used**: Terminal, Telegram, git
- **Projects Mentioned**: Clear Health Pass Woundcare, n8n, ZohoCRM, WordPress/DIVI
- **Workflow Style**: Direct, practical, prefers automation over manual steps

**Deep Profile Session** (Evening):
- **What energizes him**: Automation, problem-solving, helping users
- **Pain points**: 
  - 🔴 **Keeping track of everything** (biggest frustration)
  - 🔴 **Manual/repetitive tasks** (wants automation)
  - 🔴 **Context switching** (loses flow between projects)
- **Productive times**: Early morning, mid-morning, night owl (flexible)
- **Priorities**: Learning/experimentation, Woundcare improvements
- **Wants more time**: Learning tech, strategic thinking, music
- **Idea capture**: Voice notes (Wispr Flow), Claude AI notes
- **Environment**: 4-monitor home office/studio hybrid, professional audio setup

**Initial Insights**:
- Values simplicity and cost-effectiveness (moved away from complex MCP setups)
- Hands-on with both dev and support work
- Multi-project juggling (AWS, n8n, CRM, WordPress)
- AI-assisted "vibe coding" approach
- **Creative professional**: Production-grade audio setup for Altering Gray
- **Voice-first**: Uses Wispr Flow, prefers speaking over typing

## Automation Opportunities Identified

### HIGH PRIORITY (Based on Pain Points)

**1. "Keeping Track of Everything" Solutions**:
- [ ] Smart project status dashboard (all projects at a glance)
- [ ] Context-aware task tracking (auto-categorize by project)
- [ ] Voice-to-task capture system (Wispr → organized tasks)
- [ ] Daily digest of what's pending across all projects
- [ ] Weekly review automation (what got done, what's next)

**2. Manual/Repetitive Task Automation**:
- [ ] ZohoCRM data exports (scheduled)
- [ ] n8n workflow health monitoring (automated checks)
- [ ] AWS status checks (CloudWatch → alerts)
- [ ] WordPress update notifications
- [ ] Git commit reminders (end of work sessions)

**3. Context Switching Solutions**:
- [ ] One-command project loading (context + tools + docs)
- [ ] Project-specific sub-agents (pre-loaded expertise)
- [ ] Smart resume system ("What was I working on?")
- [ ] Auto-save work context when switching projects
- [ ] "Focus mode" that minimizes distractions per project

- Context switching → "I can load project context automatically"
- Error investigation → "I can monitor and alert proactively"

### Interjections Made
- (Date/time, what I noticed, what I suggested, outcome)
