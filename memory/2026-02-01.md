# 2026-02-01 - Daily Memory

## Morning
- Michael feedback: STOP repeating CMS $127.28/cm² skin substitute price change
  - He already knows this (knew it before I told him)
  - Was good I found it initially, but don't keep repeating it
  - Need to track what I've already told him to avoid repetition
- Config updated: memory flush + session memory search enabled

## Work Context

**MAJOR SHIFT: Autonomous Working Relationship**
Michael wants me to:
- Work autonomously overnight while he sleeps
- Wake him up to COMPLETED work, not plans
- Be proactive and build things without being asked
- Make firm nudges when he starts tasks and doesn't finish
- Ask regularly throughout day for new tasks

**Email Response Rules:**
- Morning emails (before noon): Reply by NOON
- Afternoon emails (after noon): Reply by 4 PM
- Morning briefing: 6:00-6:30 AM (while he's in bed)

**n8n Access Granted:**
- Instance: https://n8n.srv1055324.hstgr.cloud
- Full API access for automation
- Cleared old experimental workflows
- Building fresh automations for actual workflow

## Projects

**FutureNTech YouTube:**
- Voice clone setup ✅ (done yesterday)
- Outreach templates ✅ (done yesterday)
- Blocked: Reddit/Facebook account signup (Michael working on it)
- TODO: Video scripts, band research

**Altering Gray (Feb 21 - 20 days!):**
- Follow up with Ryan Koch on masters
- AI cover art variations needed
- Release announcement copy
- 30-day social content calendar
- Playlist submissions
- Press kit
- Feb 28 show promotion

**Clear Health Pass:**
- Review Henry's questions (in email)
- Deliverable testing follow-up
- Document S-Network (Google Drive)
- Training materials expansion (distributors, sales reps, doctors)

**Email Auto-Responders:**
- Elegant responses for: Onboarding, IVR, New Patient submissions
- Build in n8n

## Notes
- **Lesson learned:** Track what intelligence I've already shared with Michael
- Don't repeat the same market updates in daily briefings
- Once I've told him something, mark it as "delivered" and move on

## Decisions Made Today

**TRANSFORMATIONAL: New Autonomous Working Relationship**
- **Philosophy shift:** "Work every night while I sleep, surprise me with completed work"
- **No more waiting for instructions** - build, create, solve proactively
- **Deliver results, not plans** - show completed work in morning
- **Be firm with nudges** - interrupt when tasks are started but not finished
- **Regular check-ins** - ask throughout day for new tasks

**Email Management Protocol:**
- Morning emails (before noon) → **Must reply by NOON**
- Afternoon emails (after noon) → **Must reply by 4 PM**
- Flag overdue emails and remind Michael
- Draft responses for approval

**Morning Briefing Timing:**
- **6:00-6:30 AM** (while Michael is in bed on phone)
- Present day's work so he knows what to do when he gets up
- Include: weather, appointments, time-sensitive tasks, emails, priorities, war room intel, lyric seed

**Task Management:**
- **ONE Kanban board only:** `tasks/KANBAN.md`
- Sections: Recurring, Backlog, In Progress, Review, Activity
- Archived all old individual task files
- Simple verbal commands to update board

**Model Strategy:**
- Keep Sonnet as default (excellent balance, cost-effective)
- Don't overcomplicate with multi-model architecture
- Manual switch to Opus only when critical decisions needed
- Video advice about Opus/Codex/Gemini/Grok = overkill for our use case

**n8n Automation Access:**
- Full API access granted to Hostinger VPS instance
- Cleared old experimental workflows
- Building fresh automations for real workflow needs
- Priority: email auto-responders, morning triage, task automation

**Config Changes:**
- Enabled `compaction.memoryFlush.enabled: true`
- Enabled session memory search (experimental)
- Sources: memory + sessions

## Follow-up Items

**Tonight's Work (Autonomous):**
1. ✅ Build Kanban board (COMPLETED)
2. Build n8n email auto-responders (Onboarding, IVR, New Patient)
3. Set up morning email triage workflow
4. Write FutureNTech video scripts #1, #2, #3
5. Research 20+ unsigned metal bands database

**Blocked/Waiting:**
- Reddit account setup (Facebook signup issue)
- Facebook account setup (signup error)
- Need these for FutureNTech outreach

**Tomorrow Morning Deliverables:**
- Morning briefing at 6:30 AM
- Completed n8n automations
- FutureNTech scripts ready for review
- Band research database

## Mistakes & Lessons Learned

**Forgot context from yesterday:**
- FutureNTech form/spreadsheet already set up
- Voice clone already configured
- Outreach templates already created
- **Lesson:** Check project files and yesterday's memory BEFORE asking Michael to repeat himself

**Smart auto-switching confusion:**
- AGENTS.md says "ALWAYS ACTIVE" but it's aspirational, not technical reality
- Can't actually auto-switch models mid-conversation
- Can spawn sub-agents or manually switch
- **Lesson:** Be honest about technical limitations vs documented aspirations

**Memory tracking gap:**
- Need to track "already shared" intelligence to avoid repeating CMS price info
- Michael was right to call this out
- **Fix:** Create tracking system in war room workflow
