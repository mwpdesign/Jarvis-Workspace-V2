Templates for reaching out to bands on various platforms.

## Reddit Template (r/indieheads, r/postrock, genre-specific subs)

**Title:** "New YouTube channel featuring underground artists + strategy breakdowns - free submissions open"

**Body:**

Hey everyone!

I just launched **FutureNTech** - a YouTube channel that combines music discovery with strategy analysis. Think: "Here's an amazing underground band you've never heard of + here's the smart stuff they're doing to build their career."

Each video features a band/artist, plays their music, and breaks down what they're doing right - whether it's smart platform use, community building, DIY marketing, or whatever's working for them.

**Submissions are free and open here:** [form link]

If you're an artist or know someone who should be featured, I'd love to hear from you. Especially interested in:
- DIY artists doing innovative things
- Bands with strong engagement (even if small following)
- Artists with interesting strategies/approaches
- Any genre (post-rock, shoegaze, indie, folk, electronic - anything)

Not looking for huge followings - looking for smart artists doing cool things.

First videos dropping [date]. Would love to feature some folks from this community.

- Reference specific content
- Keep it personal, not template-y
- Use Stories for ongoing promotion

**Facebook Groups:**
- Check group rules first
- Engage in discussions
- Offer value before asking
- Don't cross-post same message to multiple groups

**Bandcamp:**
- Message artists whose work you genuinely enjoy
- Reference specific tracks/albums

---

---

## DO's and DON'Ts:

**DO:**
- Personalize every outreach
- Reference specific music/content
- Be genuine about what you like
- Respect "no" or no response
- Follow up once, then move on
- Build relationships, not just transactions

**DON'T:**
- Spam
- Use generic copy-paste messages
- Reach out to artists you haven't listened to
- Over-promise results

- Be pushy

---

**Remember:** You're offering value (exposure + strategy analysis). Be confident but respectful. Not every artist will be interested, and that's fine. Focus on those who are excited about the concept.
