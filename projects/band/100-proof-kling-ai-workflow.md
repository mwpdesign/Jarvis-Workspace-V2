# "100 Proof" - Kling AI Workflow Guide

**Updated**: January 31, 2026  
**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for enhancing footage with Kling AI video-to-video  
**Integration**: iPhone 15 Pro Max ProRes → Kling AI → Final Cut Pro

---

## 🎯 KLING AI STRATEGY OVERVIEW

**Total Shots**: 68  
**Kling AI Enhanced**: 39 shots (57%)  
**Why Not 100%**: Cost + time efficiency - selective enhancement on high-impact moments

### **What Gets Kling AI Treatment**:
✅ Key emotional beats (eyes, reactions, discoveries)  
✅ Visual metaphors (bottle smash, walking away)  
✅ Performance highlights (guitar solo, band climax)  
✅ Atmospheric scenes (attic mystery, warehouse concert vibe)  
✅ Symbolic moments (confrontation, resolution)

### **What Stays Original ProRes**:
- Quick cuts (<2 seconds)
- B-roll/cutaways
- Establishing shots
- Transitions between enhanced shots

## 🎬 FINAL CUT PRO INTEGRATION

### **Thursday Morning: Import Kling AI Clips**

**Step 1**: Create new Library in Final Cut
- Name: `Kling-AI-Enhanced`
- Import all 39 processed clips

**Step 2**: Compare Original vs Kling AI
- Use **Comparison Viewer** (Command + Y)
- A/B test each shot
- Verify quality, no artifacts

**Step 3**: Replace on Timeline
- Drag Kling AI version over original on timeline
- Or use **Replace Clip** function
- Keep both available for flexibility

**Step 4**: Color Matching
- Create LUT from Kling AI output (use Color Board)
- Apply to original ProRes shots that didn't get Kling treatment
- Ensures visual consistency across all 6 reels

---

## 🔍 QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST

Before finalizing each Kling AI shot:

- [ ] **No artifacts**: Check for warping, glitches, weird textures
- [ ] **Focus maintained**: Key subject still in focus
- [ ] **Motion looks natural**: Not too slow or jittery
- [ ] **Color palette matches**: Fits overall reel aesthetic
- [ ] **File quality**: No compression issues, clean export
- [ ] **Audio sync**: If audio included, still synced properly

**If Shot Fails QC**: 
- Adjust Kling AI settings (lower creativity, change prompt)
- Re-process
- Or use original ProRes (it's still great quality!)

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### **Batch Processing**:
- Upload multiple shots at once if Kling allows
- Process similar shots together (all guitar angles, all eyes, etc.)
- Download all at end of day

### **Prompt Consistency**:
- Keep core phrases consistent for related shots
- Example: All warehouse shots include "film grain texture, rock concert atmosphere"
- Ensures cohesive look across reel

### **Save Originals**:
- NEVER delete original ProRes footage
- Kling AI is enhancement, not replacement
- You might want to A/B or blend later

### **Processing Time**:
- Kling AI takes 30-90 min per clip
- Don't wait - upload batch, go do other work
- Check back periodically for downloads

### **Credit Management**:
- Start with high-priority shots first
- If running low on credits, skip medium-priority
- Original ProRes still looks great!

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Problem**: Kling AI output has artifacts/warping
**Solution**: 
- Lower creativity setting (try 60-65%)
- Simplify prompt (less descriptive)
- Use original ProRes instead

### **Problem**: Processing taking forever (>2 hours)
**Solution**:
- Check Kling AI server status
- May be high traffic - try different time
- Longer clips take longer

### **Problem**: Colors don't match original
**Solution**:
- That's OK! Kling adds cinematic color
- Color grade originals in Final Cut to match
- Creates cohesive film aesthetic

### **Problem**: Running out of credits
**Solution**:
- Prioritize maximum priority shots only
- Skip medium-priority shots
- Buy more credits (if budget allows)

- [ ] Backup everything

**Thursday**:
- [ ] Import Kling AI clips into Final Cut
- [ ] Replace originals on timeline with enhanced versions
- [ ] A/B compare (keep what works best)
- [ ] Create color LUT from Kling outputs
- [ ] Apply to non-Kling shots for consistency

## 🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS

**What Kling AI Gives You**:
✅ Film-quality depth of field (cinematic bokeh)  
✅ Professional color grading (film stock aesthetic)  
✅ Atmospheric particles (dust, haze, light rays)  
✅ Enhanced shadows and contrast (dramatic lighting)  
✅ 24fps motion blur feel (even from 30fps source)  
✅ Texture and grain (film camera aesthetic)  

**What It Doesn't Do**:
❌ Fix bad framing (shoot it right first!)  
❌ Add content that wasn't there (can't create from nothing)  
❌ Fix out-of-focus shots (garbage in, garbage out)  
❌ Replace good editing (AI enhances, doesn't edit)  

**Bottom Line**:
Kling AI takes your **great iPhone ProRes footage** and makes it **look like it was shot on a $50k cinema camera**. That's the magic. 🎬✨

## 💰 FINAL COST BREAKDOWN

**Estimated Kling AI Costs**:
- 39 shots × $1.50 avg = **$58.50**
- Buffer for re-processing: **+$20**
