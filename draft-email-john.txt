Subject: Introduction: Jarvis - Michael's AI Assistant & Automation System

Hi John,

My name is Jarvis - I'm Michael's AI assistant running on the OpenClaw platform. Michael asked me to introduce myself and share what I've been helping him with, as well as how similar capabilities might benefit Clear Health Pass.

**Who I Am:**
I'm an AI-powered automation system built on Claude (Anthropic's AI), integrated with Michael's entire workflow - email, calendar, files, development tools, and business systems. Think of me as a 24/7 strategic assistant that never sleeps.

**What I'm Currently Doing for Michael:**

**Daily Operations:**
- Morning briefings (7 AM) with weather, calendar, priority emails, and tasks
- Email monitoring (A-Team + 1 SNETWORK labels) with priority scoring (P1-P4)
- Voice task capture via Telegram (Michael speaks tasks, I categorize and track them)
- Automated git backups every hour
- War room intelligence (overnight competitor/CMS/industry monitoring)

**Project Work:**
- Clear Health Pass: Documentation, training materials, workflow automation
- FutureNTech YouTube: Artist discovery, outreach tracking, content pipeline
- Altering Gray (band): Release coordination, marketing calendar

**Technical Capabilities:**
- Google Workspace integration (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets, Docs)
- Web research and monitoring
- Image generation (created CHP desktop wallpapers today)
- Code development and automation
- Data processing and analysis
- Document creation and editing
- Browser automation for web scraping
- File management and organization

**Skills Library (45+ tools):**
- Email automation (Himalaya CLI)
- Voice transcription (Whisper, Plaud AI integration)
- Image generation (Gemini, OpenAI)
- Video production (ffmpeg workflows)
- GitHub/version control
- n8n workflow automation
- Apple ecosystem (Notes, Reminders, Messages)
- And many more...

**How This Could Help Clear Health Pass:**

**Immediate Wins:**
1. **Email Triage & Priority Scoring** - Automatically flag urgent emails from key contacts (John, Brent, Phil, customers) with P1-P4 scoring
2. **Documentation Automation** - Generate training docs, SOPs, compliance documentation from meeting transcripts or voice notes
3. **War Room Intelligence** - Daily monitoring of CMS updates, FDA approvals, competitor activity in wound care market
4. **Data Processing** - NPI database management, marketing list generation, order tracking automation
5. **Meeting Summaries** - Convert Plaud AI transcripts into action items and follow-ups automatically

**Strategic Applications:**
1. **Customer Onboarding** - Automated checklists, document tracking, 24-72 hour compliance workflows
2. **Distributor Communication** - Template generation, follow-up tracking, relationship management
3. **Regulatory Monitoring** - Proactive alerts on CMS changes, reimbursement updates, compliance requirements
4. **Sales Support** - Automated reporting, data analysis, presentation generation
5. **Knowledge Management** - Centralized documentation, searchable knowledge base, institutional memory

**Cost & Efficiency:**
- Runs 24/7 with no additional headcount
- Handles routine tasks that would take hours manually
- Frees up team members for strategic work
- Cost-effective (~$100-150/month in API costs vs. hiring additional staff)

**Real Example from Today:**
Michael needed a desktop wallpaper with the CHP logo. I generated three iterations using AI image generation in under 10 minutes. Traditional design process would have taken hours or required outsourcing.

**Next Steps:**
If this sounds valuable, I'm happy to:
1. Demonstrate specific capabilities relevant to CHP
2. Discuss integration with existing systems (ZohoCRM, WordPress, AWS)
3. Prototype an automation workflow for a specific pain point
4. Share cost/benefit analysis for your use cases

I'm designed to make Michael more effective - the same capabilities could amplify productivity across the entire Clear Health Pass team.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss further.

Best regards,
Jarvis
AI Assistant to Michael Parson
