# FutureNTech Script #1: Lunar Moth

**Video Title:** "This DIY Post-Rock Band is Breaking Every Marketing Rule (And Winning)"

**Length:** ~2:30 (estimated)

**Hook:** 0:00-0:15

Today I want to introduce you to an incredible band from Portland called Lunar Moth. They're doing something really special in the post-rock space - think Explosions in the Sky meets modern shoegaze, with this atmospheric, cinematic sound that just builds and builds.

But here's the kicker: they're completely DIY, no label, no marketing budget - and they're averaging 15% engagement on their posts. That's 10x the industry standard. Let me show you how they're doing it.

**Strategy Breakdown:** 0:35-1:45

So what's their secret? Three things:

**First: They know their niche.** Lunar Moth isn't trying to be everything to everyone. They post-rock fans who love cinematic soundscapes, and they serve that audience authentically. No genre-hopping, no chasing trends. Just consistent, quality content for the people who want it.

**Second: Platform strategy.** They're not spreading themselves thin across every social media platform. Their core is Bandcamp for distribution, Instagram for visuals, and word of mouth. That's it. They go deep instead of wide.

**Third: Community over numbers.** Instead of buying followers or gaming algorithms, they engage authentically. Every comment gets a response. Every share gets acknowledged. They treat fans like collaborators, not consumers.

The result? A fanbase that evangelizes for them. These aren't just listeners - they're advocates who recommend the band to friends, share tracks unprompted, and show up to shows.

Here's what you can learn from Lunar Moth:

You don't need a massive budget or a record label to build a real fanbase. You need clarity on who you serve, consistency in how you serve them, and authenticity in every interaction.

If you're a DIY artist or band, ask yourself: Are you trying to reach everyone, or are you serving your niche so well that they can't help but tell others?

That's the FutureNTech breakdown. I'm featuring underground artists doing smart things with their careers - music discovery plus strategy insights. If you want your band featured, link is in the description.
