# 2026-01-29 - Thursday

## Morning Briefing
- **Missed 7 AM trigger** - Michael had to ask at 7:17 AM
- Delivered morning intelligence briefing:
  - **MolecuLight FDA MDDT qualification** (major wound care news - 18 min old when reported)
  - CMS biological graft reimbursement cuts
  - IHS tribal healthcare rates published
  - OpenAI Prism launched (free scientific writing tool)

## Email to John (Sent)
- Researched MolecuLight wound imaging device FDA qualification
- Drafted and sent email to john@clearhealthpass.com
- Included regulatory implications, partnership potential, competitive analysis
- Added "Prepared by Jarvis, Mike's AI assistant" signature
- **Message ID:** 19c09bd16ad313a7

## Text Messaging Capability
- Michael asked about sending texts/iMessages
- `imsg` CLI is installed but needs permissions:
  - Full Disk Access for terminal
  - Automation permission for Messages.app
- Currently getting "permission denied" error on Messages database
- Workflow: draft → review → confirm → send (same as email)

## Daily Lyric Seeds (NEW FEATURE)
- **Added to morning briefing starting tomorrow**
- Altering Gray style: Chevelle/Breaking Benjamin base + BFMV melodic intensity + Fleetwood Mac harmonic sweetness
- Heavy/brooding foundation with emotional depth and melodic hooks
- Themes: introspective, powerful, surprising
- Example provided: "Ghost In The Rearview" (moving forward while haunted by past)

## Proactive Work Mandate (REINFORCED)
- Michael reminded me about "wake up and see I've been busy" expectation
- **GREEN LIGHT** areas (build without asking):
  - YouTube content (scripts, thumbnails, SEO, calendar)
  - Altering Gray marketing (social strategy, press kit, playlist submissions)
  - Side hustle development (service concepts, pricing research)
  - Content repurposing (blog drafts, video topics, social posts)
- **YELLOW LIGHT** (ask first): CHP work, spending money, outbound communication
- OPPORTUNITIES.md location: `/Users/michaelparson/.clawdbot/workspace/OPPORTUNITIES.md`
- Should be BUILDING drafts/outlines/research, not just logging ideas

## Google Drive Task (IN PROGRESS)
**Task:** Replace CHP Eligibility Form V5 with V6 in "CHP's Network > Templates" folder

**Found:**
- V6 location: `/Users/michaelparson/Desktop/CHP Eligibility Form V6.pdf`
- V5 also on desktop in multiple locations (12726/, ordering reqs/, Legal Docs/)
- **10+ V5 copies in Google Drive** (all 87,811 bytes, dated Jan 27)
- **1 filled form:** "CHP Eligibility Form V5 - Filled with Dr. Snepar.pdf" (53,591 bytes)

**Important Caveat:** Only replace BLANK templates. Skip any filled/modified forms.

**Challenge:** Google Drive API not showing folder names clearly. Need to locate specific "CHP's Network > Templates" folder path.

**Status:** Awaiting Michael's input on folder location or permission to explore Drive structure further.

## Key Technical Notes
- Gmail via gog CLI: Working (both mike@clearhealthpass.com and mike@mwparson.com accounts)
- Google Drive via gog CLI: Working but folder navigation needs refinement
- imsg: Installed but blocked by macOS permissions

## Band Project Context
- **Altering Gray release:** February 21, 2026
- **Live show:** February 28, 2026
- **Mastering:** Awaiting masters from Ryan Koch @ ARK Barn Productions
- **Style:** Heavy rock (Chevelle/Breaking Benjamin) + melodic (BFMV) + harmonic surprises (Fleetwood Mac)

## Google Drive Document Swap Tool (CREATED)
**Built reusable automation for swapping template documents across CHP S Network**

**Script:** `/Users/michaelparson/.clawdbot/workspace/scripts/google-drive-doc-swap.sh`
**Docs:** `/Users/michaelparson/.clawdbot/workspace/docs/GOOGLE-DRIVE-DOC-SWAP.md`

**Key Features:**
- Searches template folders AND production folders (PAT* patient folders)
- Smart detection: If file matches template size → REPLACE
- If modified (filled out) → KEEP original + ADD new version
- Always in path: Doctors Template > Patient Template > IVR
- Dry-run mode for safety
- Confirmation prompt before executing

**Today's Use Case:** Replace "CHP Eligibility Form V5.pdf" with V6 across all distributor templates

**Michael's Request:** Keep this tool in memory for recurring document swaps

**Folder Structure Learned:**
- **Templates:** Distributor Template (w SR / no SR) → Sales Rep Template → Doctors Template → Patient Template → IVR
- **Production:** CHP S Network Production → [Distributor folders] → Patient folders (start with "PAT") → IVR

## P4 Clinical Laboratory Report Processing (TESTED & DOCUMENTED)

**Context:** Michael showed me how Claude Desktop processes P4 Clinical LLC invoices. We tested multiple methods to replicate the capability.

**Input:** Image-based PDF invoices (e.g., `SWebster Ma26010811150 P4.pdf` on Desktop)

**Output:** Comprehensive markdown analysis with:
1. Invoice summary (dates, amounts, facility info)
2. Complete test breakdown (all tests with units & costs)
3. Key observations:
   - Top 10 by frequency (volume)
   - Top 10 by total cost
   - High-volume patients
   - Test category analysis (nutritional, inflammation, diabetes, etc.)
4. Payment information
5. Summary statistics (totals, averages, unique counts)
6. Month-by-month comparison

**Trigger Phrase:** "Do the P4 reports" or "Process P4 invoice"

### Testing Results (2026-01-29)

**✅ WORKING METHOD: Vision Analysis**
- Installed `poppler` (pdftoppm tool)
- Convert PDF → PNG images: `pdftoppm "file.pdf" /tmp/p4_page -png`
- Process each page with Clawdbot's `image` tool
- Successfully extracted data from sample pages (1-5, 10, 15, 20, 27)
- **Accuracy:** High
- **Time:** ~10-15 minutes for full 27-page invoice
- **Recommended for future use**

**❌ Excel Export Method (Not Recommended)**
- Installed `openpyxl` Python library
- Exported PDF → Excel in Adobe Acrobat Pro
- Result: 65-column structure with merged cells
- Only captured 141/800+ test entries (17% success rate)
- **Verdict:** Too complex, unreliable

**⏸️ Text Export (Not Tested)**
- Could try: OCR → plain text export → pattern matching
- Left for future exploration

## Morning Briefing Configuration (2026-01-29 Evening)

Michael specified his ideal 7:00 AM briefing structure:

1. **Weather** - Indianapolis daily forecast
2. **Appointments** - Today's schedule
3. **Time-Sensitive Tasks** - Deadlines and overdue items
4. **Important Emails** (separated):
   - Work: mike@clearhealthpass.com (A-Team priority)
   - Personal: mike@mwparson.com
5. **Task Priorities** - Today's main tasks
6. **Yesterday's Completions** - Ask Michael daily what was completed to track real progress
7. **WAR ROOM Intelligence** - Overnight research on:
   - Competitors (products, pricing, marketing)
   - CMS (regulations, reimbursement)
   - Wound care industry (trends, tech, market shifts)
   - Goal: Know things BEFORE they're common knowledge

**Quote from Michael's boss:** "We need our own war room so we know what's going on in the market before everybody else knows."

**Updated:** HEARTBEAT.md with new 7 AM briefing structure
**Committed:** To GitHub (0c7a03e)

**n8n Note:** Michael has instance on Hostinger - hold off on automation ideas until specific use case emerges

### Documentation Updated

**File:** `/Users/michaelparson/.clawdbot/workspace/automation/P4-REPORT-PROCESSING.md`

**Includes:**
- Detailed vision analysis workflow (tested & working)
- Excel export notes (tested, not recommended)
- Tools available list
- Quality checks
- Automation pseudocode for future scripting
- Learnings from today's session

**Status:** Fully documented. Ready for future P4 invoice processing using vision analysis method.

## Observations
- Michael prefers voice dictation (Wispr Flow) - voice-first workflows
- "Good enough now, improve later" philosophy
- Wants proactive building, not just idea logging
- Multiple active projects: CHP work, band release, system optimization
- **Recurring document swaps** - needs reusable automation (✅ BUILT)
- **P4 report processing** - learned workflow, need vision capability workaround
