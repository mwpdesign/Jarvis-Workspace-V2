# FutureNTech Growth Strategy

**Mission:** Build a thriving community and maximize reach for unsigned rock/metal artists

---

## Core Growth Principles

1. **Value First:** Every video must give viewers something (discovery, knowledge, inspiration)
2. **Community Building:** We're not just a channel, we're a movement for unsigned artists
3. **Consistent Quality:** Professional production = credibility = shares
4. **SEO Optimization:** Every video optimized for discovery
5. **Cross-Platform Presence:** YouTube is home base, but promote everywhere

## Video Production Strategy

### Every Video Must Include:

**📺 Video Structure (Proven YouTube Format):**
1. **Hook (0-5 sec):** "This unsigned band from [location] just dropped the heaviest track of 2026..."
2. **Promise (5-15 sec):** "By the end, you'll see how they used AI to master their sound..."
3. **Content (bulk):** Artist story, music showcase, tech breakdown
4. **CTA (end):** "Submit YOUR band, link in description!"

**🎯 CTAs to Include (Every Video):**
- **Verbal CTA (2-3 times per video):**
  - Opening: "Hit subscribe to discover bands like this weekly"
  - Middle: "Drop a comment - which artist should we feature next?"
  - End: "Click that subscribe button, turn on notifications, and submit YOUR band below!"
  
- **On-Screen Graphics:**
  - Animated "SUBSCRIBE" button (lower third, 10-15 seconds in)
  - "👇 SUBMIT YOUR BAND 👇" text overlay (end screen)
  - Like icon animation reminder

- **End Screen (last 20 seconds):**
  - Subscribe button (prominent)
  - Next video thumbnail (keep them watching)
  - "Submit Your Band" link
  - Social media handles

**📝 Description Template (Every Video):**
