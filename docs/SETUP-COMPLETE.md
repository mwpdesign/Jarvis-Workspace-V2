## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Every 30 Minutes (Heartbeat)
I automatically check:
- Is it a new day? → Create daily memory log
- Workspace changes uncommitted? → Remind if > 24hrs
- System needs update? → Suggest if > 7 days
- Weekly/monthly tasks? → Alert on schedule

### When You Ask Me to Work on a Project
1. You say: "Work on Clear Health Pass Woundcare"
2. I load: `projects/clear-health-pass-woundcare.md`
3. I have context: Tech stack, responsibilities, commands
4. I'm ready: To help with that specific project

### Memory Management
- **You ask something**: I search memory first
- **We make a decision**: I log it to memory
- **End of day**: I update the daily log
- **All backed up**: Git commits automatically

---

## 📱 How to Reach Me

1. **Telegram** (@MWPJarvisBot) - Fastest, mobile
2. **Webchat** (http://localhost:18789) - Long sessions
3. **Terminal** - Deep work (this session)

## 🛠️ What You Can Do Now

### Just Ask Naturally:
- "Work on n8n workflows"
- "Search memory for AWS deployment"
- "Create a training doc for Woundcare"
- "Check my GitHub issues"
- "What's the weather?"
- "Add this to Apple Notes"
- "Help me optimize this code"

### I'll Handle:
- Loading the right project context
- Searching relevant memory
- Using the appropriate skills
- Committing work to git
- Logging important decisions

## 🎓 Advanced Features

### Sub-Agents (Background Work)
For long tasks, I can spawn sub-agents:
```
"Spawn a sub-agent to analyze all our n8n workflows and suggest optimizations"
```

They work independently and ping you when done.

### Cron Jobs (Scheduled Tasks)
I can set up recurring tasks:
```
"Remind me every Monday at 9am to review the weekly metrics"
```

### Git Workflow
Your workspace is now backed up:
```bash
cd ~/.clawdbot/workspace
git log  # See all changes
git diff  # See uncommitted changes
```
