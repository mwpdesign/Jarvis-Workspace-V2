# FutureNTech - Band Discovery Workflow

**CRITICAL:** We need real bands before making scripts. Here's the process:

---

## Phase 1: Find Potential Bands

### Where to Look:

**Bandcamp (Primary Source):**
1. Go to https://bandcamp.com/tag/post-rock (or other genres)
2. Filter by "newest" or "best-selling"
3. Look for bands with:
   - Recent releases (2024-2025)
   - Small following but active engagement
   - Good production quality
   - Interesting story/approach

**Reddit:**
- r/postrock - "New music" posts
- r/indieheads - Fresh finds
- r/WeAreTheMusicMakers - Self-promotion threads
- Genre-specific subs (r/shoegaze, r/mathrock, etc.)

**Instagram:**
- Hashtags: #DIYmusician, #indieartist, #postrock, #bandc
amp
- Follow small indie labels and see who they're promoting
- Check who comments on similar artists

**Facebook Groups:**
- "DIY Musicians"
- Genre-specific groups
- Local music scene groups

## Phase 2: Evaluate Candidates

### Criteria Checklist:

**Music Quality:**
- [ ] Production quality acceptable for YouTube feature
- [ ] Style fits channel vibe (underground, authentic, interesting)
- [ ] At least one standout track worth featuring

**Strategy Interest:**
- [ ] Something interesting about their approach (DIY, platform strategy, community building, etc.)
- [ ] Story worth telling beyond "they make good music"
- [ ] Evidence of engagement (comments, shares, active fanbase)

**Practical:**
- [ ] Can contact them (email, Bandcamp message, Instagram DM)
- [ ] Likely to respond/be interested
- [ ] Music they own or have rights to

---

## Phase 3: Initial Contact

**Before reaching out:**
1. Listen to at least 3 tracks
2. Check their social media for engagement patterns
3. Identify what makes them interesting strategically
4. Screenshot any impressive metrics

**First Contact:**
- Use templates from OUTREACH-TEMPLATES.md
- Personalize with specific references to their music
- Be genuine - only reach out if you actually like them
- Link to submission form OR offer to chat first

---

## Phase 4: Script Development

**ONLY after you have:**
1. ✅ Band confirmed interested
2. ✅ Permission to use music
3. ✅ Their story/strategy details
4. ✅ Access to visuals (photos, artwork)

**Then:**
- Write script based on actual band
- Send to Michael for approval
- Get band's approval on how they're portrayed
- Produce video

## Quick Start: First 5 Bands

2. Find 10 candidates
3. Narrow to 5 best fits
4. Reach out with personalized messages
5. See who responds

**Option B: Community Outreach (Immediate)**
1. Post on Reddit (r/postrock, r/WeAreTheMusicMakers)
2. Share submission form
3. Engage with responses
4. Select best submissions for first features

**Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)**
1. Post submission form to communities

## Michael's Decision:

**Do you want to:**

**A) Build submission form first, let bands come to you**
- Faster setup
- Less work upfront
- Quality control might be harder
- Takes time to get submissions

**B) Hand-pick first 5-10 bands yourself**
- Better quality control
- You choose exactly who you want
- More work upfront
- Can launch faster if you find good ones

**C) Hybrid: Form + manual outreach**
- Best of both worlds
- More effort but better results
- Can launch with hand-picked bands
- Build submission pipeline for future

## Next Steps (Your Call):

1. **Build submission form** (I can do this in 30 min)
2. **Find 5 real bands** (you browse, I research based on your picks)
3. **Write first REAL script** (after you approve a band)
4. **Produce test video** (with approved band + script)

**What's your move?**
