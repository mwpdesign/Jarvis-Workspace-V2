- **Strategy**: Prioritize new releases for higher response rates and relationship building
- **Next**: Build Bandcamp scraper to feed FutureNTech pipeline

## Next Actions
- Build Bandcamp scraper for US artist discovery
- Update TASK-003 to reflect Bandcamp-only strategy
- Monitor task completion throughout the day

## Bandcamp Artist Discovery (1:40-1:45 PM)
**Completed:** Manual Bandcamp scraping for FutureNTech
- **Issue:** Bandcamp uses JavaScript-rendered content (can't scrape with simple requests)
- **Solution:** Used web search to find recent US-based Bandcamp releases
- **Results:** Found and added 5 artists to FutureNTech outreach sheet:
  1. Coniferous Myst (Dungeon Synth / Black Metal, USA)
  2. Pragata (Blackened Death Metal, USA/Punjab)
  3. Saxon Moon (Celtic Folk Rock, Texas)
  4. Haurun (Stoner Rock, San Francisco)
  5. Corespondents (Instrumental Rock, Seattle)
- **Next:** Build full automation with browser automation (added to tasks/futurentech.md)

## Follow-Through Accountability System (3:00 PM)
**Decision:** Implement weekly follow-through check-ins
- **Format:** "Week in Review" section in Friday morning briefings
- **Content:** What I committed to this week, what got done, what's carrying over
- **Why:** Close accountability gap - ensure commitments don't get forgotten
- **Implementation:** Fold into existing Friday briefing (less noise, one touchpoint)
- **Action:** Update morning briefing documentation to include Friday follow-through section
