Hey [BAND_NAME],

I discovered your music on Bandcamp and I'm genuinely impressed — [SPECIFIC_COMPLIMENT about their sound/production/story].

I run **FutureNTech** on YouTube, a channel that spotlights underground artists pushing boundaries with DIY production and innovative approaches. Your work is exactly what we're looking for.

**What we do:**
- 6-8 minute video features highlighting your music, story, and creative process
- Focus on DIY/bedroom production techniques
- Audience of musicians and producers looking for inspiration
- Completely free — no cost, no strings attached

**What we need from you (if interested):**
- A few high-quality photos (band/performance/studio)
- Permission to use clips from your tracks
- A bit about your creative process and gear setup

We handle everything else — scripting, production, editing, upload.

All the best,

## Personalization Notes (per band)

**Usury:** "Your old-school death metal sound is crushing — love the raw production on 'Carnage Eternal'. The DIY approach really shines through."

**Mantera Anarchist:** "Malaysian thrash with that Bay Area intensity? Sign me up. Your production quality is seriously impressive for an independent project."

**Volubilis:** "The atmospheric layers you achieve on 'Eclipse' are stunning. How are you getting those textures in a home setup?"

**thistle.:** "The way you blend shoegaze and post-metal is beautiful — very 'Deafheaven meets Alcest'. What's your pedal chain looking like?"

**dead things:** "That sludgy doom tone is massive. Are you recording through actual amps or going digital?"

**Void:** "The ambient interludes between the black metal passages create such tension. What software are you using for those soundscapes?"
