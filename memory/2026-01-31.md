## Altering Gray "100 Proof" Video - MAJOR UPDATE 🎬

**Project Upgrade: v1.0 → v2.0**

Michael decided to integrate **Kling AI** video enhancement into the "100 Proof" music video workflow!

**New Tech Stack:**
- **Capture:** iPhone 15 Pro Max → ProRes 4K 30fps → USB-C External SSD
- **Enhancement:** Kling AI (video-to-video) - 39 priority shots (57% of footage)
- **Edit:** Final Cut Pro (magnetic timeline, beat markers, compound clips)
- **Result:** Film-quality cinematic production (looks like $50k budget on $300 DIY cost)

**What Changed:**
1. ~~Standard iPhone video~~ → **ProRes 4K recording** (cinema-quality source)
2. ~~DaVinci Resolve~~ → **Final Cut Pro** (Michael already has it, better workflow)
3. **NEW:** Kling AI enhancement on key shots (bottle smash, guitar solo, emotional beats)
4. **NEW:** USB-C direct recording to external SSD (no phone storage limits)
5. Budget: $55-85 → **$210-325** (added SSD + Kling AI credits)

**Files Created (v2.0):**
- `100-proof-video-storyboard-v2.md` - Complete rework with Kling AI prompts for each shot
- `100-proof-shooting-schedule-v2.md` - Updated with ProRes workflow, 68 shots total
- `100-proof-kling-ai-workflow.md` - NEW! Step-by-step Kling AI processing guide
- `100-proof-video-project-status-v2.md` - Updated project status with new workflow

**Key Features:**
- **Kling AI Priority System:**
  - MAXIMUM: Bottle smash, eyes close-ups, guitar solo (9 shots)
  - HIGH: Performance, attic mystery, emotional beats (20 shots)
  - MEDIUM: Additional atmosphere shots (10 shots)
- **Production Timeline:** 3 weeks (Week 1-2: Shoot ProRes, Week 3: Kling AI + Edit)
- **Expected Quality:** Film-grade cinematic (depth of field, color grading, atmosphere, grain)

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Buy USB-C external SSD (500GB-1TB) - Samsung T7 or SanDisk Extreme
2. Test ProRes recording to SSD on iPhone 15 Pro Max
3. Create Kling AI account + buy credits ($50-100)
4. Scout locations and gather props

**Why This Matters:**
- Competitive edge: 99% of DIY music videos don't have this quality
- Press angle: "Shot on iPhone, enhanced with AI" = unique story
- ROI: Looks like $50k production, costs $300 - if it gets one extra booking, pays for entire album

**Michael's Reaction:** Excited! Watching Kling 01 tutorials, ready to make this look "really cinematic."
