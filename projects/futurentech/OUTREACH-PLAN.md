# FutureNTech Outreach Plan

**Goal:** Find 10-20 interested unsigned bands for first videos  
**Timeline:** Start immediately  
**Target:** Bands with quality music, interesting stories, active on social media

---

## Outreach Strategy

### Phase 1: Find Promising Bands (Days 1-3)

**Reddit (Primary Source):**
- r/IndieMusicFeedback (180k members)
- r/WeAreTheMusicMakers (2M members)
- r/Music
- r/Metal, r/Rock, r/IndieMusic (genre-specific)

**Bandcamp:**
- Search "new releases" by genre
- Look for recent uploads, good production
- Check if active on social (they'll share the video)

**Instagram/TikTok:**
- #unsignedartist #indiemusic #newmusic
- Bands with 500-5k followers (sweet spot)
- Actively posting (not dormant accounts)

**Selection Criteria:**
- ✅ Good production quality (doesn't have to be pro)
- ✅ Active on social media (will share video)
- ✅ Under 50k monthly listeners (true discovery)
- ✅ Has interesting story/angle (DIY, tech, breakthrough moment)
- ✅ Responds to DMs/comments (engaged artist)

### Midday (20 minutes):
1. Browse Bandcamp new releases (genre-specific)
2. Listen to 10-15 bands
3. Comment on 3-5 best ones with form link

## What NOT to Do

❌ Mass spam (gets flagged, looks desperate)
❌ Copy-paste generic messages (no engagement)
❌ DM without listening to music first (disingenuous)
❌ Overpromise views/results (set realistic expectations)
❌ Contact signed artists or big names (not our niche)

✅ Listen to their music first
✅ Personalize messages ("Love your [specific song]")
✅ Engage genuinely (comment, upvote, like)
✅ Be transparent about what we offer
✅ Focus on bands who'll actually benefit

## Tracking Outreach

**Google Sheet:** [Create tracking spreadsheet]

| Date | Platform | Band Name | Link | Message Sent | Response | Submitted? |
|------|----------|-----------|------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-03 | Reddit | Example Band | link | Yes | Pending | No |

**Track:**
- Where we found them
- When we contacted them
- Their response (interested, no response, declined)
- Whether they submitted form
- Priority (high/medium/low for first videos)

---

## Response Rate Expectations

**Realistic:**
- 10-20% response rate (1-2 replies per 10 messages)
- 5-10% submission rate (1 submission per 20 messages)
- Goal: 10 submissions = 200 outreach contacts

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: 70 contacts (10/day)
- Week 2: 70 contacts (10/day)
- Week 3: 60 contacts (10/day)
- **Total: 200 contacts = ~10 submissions**

---

## First Video Selection

Once we have 5+ submissions:
1. Review all submissions
2. Pick 3 best candidates:
   - Quality music
   - Compelling story
   - Most likely to share/promote
3. Send to Michael for approval
4. Script first video
5. Contact artist for permission/details
6. Produce and upload

---

## Outreach Ethics

**Be transparent:**
- We're a new channel (starting out)
- No guaranteed views/results
- Free feature, no payment either way
- They own their music, we just showcase it

**Be respectful:**
- If they say no, thank them and move on
- Don't spam or pester
- Honor their requests (credit, links, etc.)
- Be professional in all communications
