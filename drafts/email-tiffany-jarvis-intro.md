**Subject:** Introducing Jarvis - My AI Assistant

Hi Tiffany,

I wanted to introduce you to Jarvis, my AI assistant that's been helping me manage work tasks and projects. Thought you might find it interesting (and potentially useful for your own workflow).

## What Jarvis Is

Jarvis is an AI-powered personal assistant running on Clawdbot (think of it like a super-powered ChatGPT that can actually do things on my computer). It has access to my email, calendar, files, and can execute tasks automatically.

## What Jarvis Does for Me

**Work Management:**
- Monitors my work email (mike@clearhealthpass.com) and flags important messages from A-Team members
- Manages my Google Calendar and reminds me of upcoming meetings
- Organizes tasks by project (Woundcare, ZohoCRM, WordPress, Band, etc.)
- Captures voice-dictated tasks via Telegram and categorizes them automatically

**Daily Operations:**
- Sends me a 7:00 AM briefing every morning with:
  - Weather forecast
  - Today's appointments
  - Important emails (work + personal)
  - Time-sensitive tasks and deadlines
  - Industry intelligence ("war room" competitor monitoring)

**Research & Intelligence:**
- Monitors competitors (Integra, MiMedx, Organogenesis, Smith+Nephew)
- Tracks CMS/Medicare policy changes affecting skin substitutes
- Searches X/Twitter for industry trends
- Summarizes YouTube videos, articles, and documents
- Performs web research and data analysis

**Automation & Technical Work:**
- Writes and executes scripts
- Manages files and documentation
- Creates tools (like the Opportunity Kanban board I built this morning)
- Processes data (like P4 Clinical reports)
- Handles Git commits and backups

**Proactive Support:**
- Suggests automations when it spots repetitive work
- Flags opportunities for revenue or efficiency gains
- Keeps me updated on new AI tools and industry trends
- Tracks my projects and reminds me of deadlines

## Example Use Cases

- **Voice Task Capture:** I can say "Remind me to send the sign-off sheet to Tiffany, Sil, and Kenya" via Wispr Flow → Telegram, and Jarvis captures it to my task list automatically
- **Email Triage:** Jarvis monitors my inbox and highlights emails from you, Phil, John, Brent, and other A-Team members
- **Meeting Prep:** Before meetings, I can ask Jarvis to pull relevant docs, transcripts, or context
- **Research:** "What's the latest CMS policy on skin substitutes?" → Jarvis searches and summarizes

## How It Works

Jarvis runs 24/7 on my Mac, with heartbeat checks every 30 minutes. I interact with it via:
- **Telegram** (primary interface - voice or text)
- **Terminal** (for technical work)
- **Email** (it can draft/send emails on my behalf after review)

It has access to:
- Gmail (work + personal)
- Google Calendar
- Google Drive
- File system
- Web search & browsing
- X/Twitter
- Various APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)

## Privacy & Security

- Jarvis only accesses my accounts (not yours or anyone else's)
- All data stays local on my Mac
- It asks permission before sending emails or making public posts
- I review anything sensitive before it goes out

## Why I'm Telling You This

1. You might find Jarvis's capabilities helpful for your own work
2. If I ever mention "Jarvis did X" in conversation, you'll know what I'm talking about
3. If you see emails from me that say "Prepared by Jarvis" at the bottom, that's what's happening

Happy to show you more if you're interested! It's been a huge productivity boost.

Best,
Mike
