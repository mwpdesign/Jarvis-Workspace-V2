# CMS 2026 Skin Substitute Reimbursement Changes
## Impact Analysis & Strategic Response for Clear Health Pass

**Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Prepared by:** Michael Parson, Solutions Architect  
**For:** John Cataldi, CEO  
**Subject:** Critical regulatory change affecting Q4250 (AmnioAMP-MP) and Q4347 (Rampart DL Matrix)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Effective January 1, 2026, CMS fundamentally restructured Medicare reimbursement for skin substitute products, reducing reimbursement rates by approximately **83-96%** for most products, including Clear Health Pass's Q4347 (Rampart DL Matrix) and Q4250 (AmnioAMP-MP).

**Critical Financial Impact:**
- **Rampart DL Matrix (Q4347)**: Previous rate $3,000/unit → New rate $127.28/cm²
- **Estimated revenue impact:** Potentially $6-28 million annually (depending on volume and per-unit size)
- **Market-wide impact:** CMS projects 90% reduction in skin substitute spending ($19.6B savings in 2026)

**Tribal Sovereignty Issue:**
Clear Health Pass, as a tribally-owned enterprise, was not consulted in the rulemaking process despite submitting clinical studies. This represents a potential violation of federal tribal consultation requirements and creates grounds for regulatory appeal.

**Recommended Action:** Immediate regulatory appeal to CMS citing tribal consultation failures, economic impact on tribal enterprise, and review of submitted clinical studies.

## 1. REGULATORY CHANGES OVERVIEW

### What Changed on January 1, 2026

**Old System (Pre-2026):**
- Skin substitutes paid as "biologicals" under ASP+6% methodology
- Each product received unique billing code and payment limit
- Prices ranged from $100 to $2,000+ per square centimeter
- Industry average: $789/cm²

**New System (2026 Forward):**
- Most skin substitutes reclassified as "incident-to supplies"
- Uniform flat rate: **$127.28 per square centimeter**
- Rate applies across physician offices AND hospital outpatient settings
- Separate rates by category planned for 2027+ (361 HCT/P, 510(k), PMA)

**Exception:**
Only products with FDA Section 351 BLA (Biologics License Application) retain ASP+6% methodology. These products are "relatively rare" due to high regulatory burden (full clinical trials, manufacturing controls, post-market surveillance).

---

## 2. WHY CMS MADE THIS CHANGE

### Spending Crisis
- Medicare Part B spending exploded from **$252 million (2019) → $10 billion (2024)**
- 40-fold increase while patient volume only doubled
- CMS identified widespread profiteering and inappropriate use

### Industry Abuses Cited by CMS
- Manufacturers launching products at inflated prices
- "Spread pricing" schemes exploiting ASP+6% loopholes
- Inappropriate use on vulnerable populations
- Concentration of abuse among outlier providers
- CMS stopped $185 million in improper payments in 2025 alone

### CMS Goals
- Reduce fraud and waste
- Eliminate financial incentives driving overutilization
- Create level playing field based on clinical merit vs. price
- Preserve patient access while cutting spending

---

## 3. CLEAR HEALTH PASS PRODUCT CLASSIFICATION

### Q4250 (AmnioAMP-MP)
**Manufacturer:** CellGenuity Regenerative Science  
**FDA Classification:** **361 HCT/P** (Human Cells/Tissues/Cellular-Based Products)
- Registered under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (21 CFR 1271.10)
- Self-registered with FDA (no BLA license, no clinical trials required)
- Product type: Dual-layer dehydrated amniotic membrane
- Homologous use only: Physical wound covering

**2026 Status:** ❌ Subject to $127.28/cm² flat rate

---

### Q4347 (Rampart DL Matrix)
**Manufacturer:** Likely MTF Biologics (based on product line research)  
**FDA Classification:** Almost certainly **361 HCT/P** or **510(k) device**
- No evidence of Section 351 BLA license
- Part of MTF's "minimally processed" tissue product line
- Described as retaining "structural properties of extracellular matrix"

**2026 Status:** ❌ Subject to $127.28/cm² flat rate

**Previous Reimbursement:** $3,000 per unit (size/cm² unknown)

---

## 4. FINANCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Rampart DL Matrix (Q4347) - Impact Scenarios

**Need clarification:** Is $3,000 per square centimeter or per graft unit?

#### Scenario A: If $3,000 per square centimeter
- **Old rate:** $3,000/cm²
- **New rate:** $127.28/cm²
- **Loss per cm²:** $2,872.72 (95.8% reduction)
- **Impact per 10cm² graft:** $28,727 revenue loss

#### Scenario B: If $3,000 per graft (e.g., 4cm² = $750/cm²)
- **Old rate:** $750/cm²
- **New rate:** $127.28/cm²
- **Loss per cm²:** $622.72 (83% reduction)
- **Impact per 10cm² graft:** $6,227 revenue loss

### Annual Revenue Impact (Estimates)

**To calculate precise impact, need:**
1. Annual volume sold (square centimeters per year)
2. Product mix (Q4250 vs Q4347 revenue split)
3. Previous ASP+6% rate for Q4250

**Example calculation (if 10,000 cm²/year at Scenario B rate):**
- Lost revenue: 10,000 cm² × $622.72 = **$6.2 million/year**

## 5. TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY ISSUE

### Federal Tribal Consultation Requirements

Clear Health Pass Holdings, LLC is a **tribally-owned enterprise**. Federal agencies are generally required to consult with tribal governments before implementing policies that significantly affect:
- Tribal economic development
- Tribal self-determination
- Tribal sovereignty

**Key Legal Frameworks:**
- Executive Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments)
- Executive Order 13084 (predecessor, still referenced)
- Tribal Self-Governance Act
- Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act

### Clear Health Pass Position

**Facts:**
1. ✅ Tribally-owned company
2. ✅ Submitted clinical studies to CMS
3. ❌ Not consulted in rulemaking process
4. ❌ Not invited to participate in LCD development meetings
5. ❌ Rampart DL not included on approved products list despite submitted studies

**Regulatory Grievance:**
CMS appears to have failed to:
- Notify tribal government of impending rule changes
- Provide opportunity for tribal consultation
- Review submitted studies from tribally-owned manufacturers
- Consider economic impact on tribal economic development

### Economic Impact on Tribal Enterprise

**Direct Impacts:**
- 83-96% revenue reduction on major product line
- Potential job losses (tribal employment)
- Reduced tribal economic self-sufficiency
- Impact on tribal healthcare infrastructure investments

**Tribal Economic Development:**
Healthcare manufacturing is a strategic priority for many tribal nations seeking economic diversification beyond gaming. This rule change directly undermines those efforts.

- Low-cost manufacturers already near $127 price point
- Companies with strong clinical differentiation
- Large hospital systems with purchasing power

**Losers:**
- High-priced products ($1,000+/cm²) - massive cuts
- Smaller manufacturers without hospital contracts
- Companies built on ASP+6% arbitrage
- Providers without volume to sustain low margins

**Market Consolidation Expected:**
- Weaker competitors will exit market
- Acquisition opportunities for well-capitalized companies
- Market share up for grabs

### Clear Health Pass Competitive Position

**Strengths:**
- Tribally-owned status (unique regulatory angle)
- Clinical studies already submitted
- Established relationships with distributors
- Product quality and efficacy track record

**Challenges:**
- High previous price point ($3,000/unit)
- Unclear profitability at $127.28/cm² rate
- Need for cost structure optimization
- Limited cash reserves for extended legal/regulatory battle

---

## 7. STRATEGIC RESPONSE OPTIONS

### Option A: Regulatory Appeal (RECOMMENDED - IMMEDIATE)

**Tribal Consultation Failure Argument:**
1. File formal comment/appeal with CMS Administrator
2. Copy HHS Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs (tribal liaison)
3. Request:
   - Review of submitted clinical studies
   - Tribal consultation on economic impact
   - Exemption or special consideration for tribally-owned products
   - Extension of comment period to allow tribal participation

**Timeline:** File within 30 days (before February 28, 2026)

**Resources Needed:**
- Tribal attorney familiar with federal consultation requirements
- Economic impact data (revenue, jobs, tribal economic development)
- Clinical study documentation
- Letters of support from tribal leadership

**Probability of Success:** Moderate to High
- Tribal consultation requirements are taken seriously
- Economic impact on tribal enterprise is legally significant
- CMS has history of accommodating tribal concerns

---

### Option B: Congressional Intervention

**Congressional Tribal Caucus:**
- 4 Native American members of Congress (2 Senators, 2 Representatives)
- Strong advocates for tribal economic development
- Can request CMS review or legislation

**Approach:**
1. Contact tribal liaison offices at CMS/HHS
2. Request meeting with Congressional tribal caucus members
3. Provide economic impact data and tribal consultation failure documentation
4. Request Congressional inquiry or GAO investigation

**Timeline:** 60-90 days for response

---

### Option C: Clinical Evidence Path

**If studies submitted were not RCTs:**
- Design and execute randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for Rampart DL
- Demonstrate statistically significant efficacy for DFU/VLU treatment
- Submit to CMS for inclusion on approved products list

**Timeline:** 2-3 years (too slow for immediate relief)

**Cost:** $2-5 million for full RCT

**Outcome:** If successful, product approved but still subject to $127.28/cm² rate (not ASP+6%)

---

### Option D: Pursue Section 351 BLA License

**Long-term strategy:**
- Apply for FDA Biologics License Application (BLA)
- Requires full clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy
- Products with BLA retain ASP+6% methodology

**Timeline:** 4-7 years

**Cost:** $10-30 million

**Probability:** Low (very few wound care products have achieved BLA)

---

### Option E: Cost Restructuring & Market Share Growth

**If regulatory appeal fails:**
1. Optimize production costs to achieve profitability at $127.28/cm²
2. Renegotiate supplier/distributor agreements
3. Increase volume to offset reduced margins
4. Acquire struggling competitors at discount
5. Focus on clinical differentiation vs. price

**Timeline:** 6-12 months

**Risk:** May not be profitable at new rates

---

## 13. CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATION

The CMS 2026 skin substitute reimbursement changes represent an **existential threat** to Clear Health Pass's wound care product line. Revenue reductions of 83-96% are **not sustainable** without immediate action.

**Primary Recommendation:**
**Pursue regulatory appeal citing tribal consultation failure** while simultaneously optimizing cost structure for continued operations.

**Rationale:**
1. Strong legal/regulatory grounds (tribal sovereignty protections)
2. Modest cost ($50-200K) relative to potential impact ($6-28M annual revenue)
3. Buys time for operational optimization
4. Demonstrates tribal economic development concerns to federal government
5. Creates precedent supporting other tribal enterprises

**Secondary Recommendation:**
**Conduct financial viability analysis within 30 days** to determine whether Q4347 can be profitable at $127.28/cm² rate. If not, prepare exit strategy while pursuing regulatory relief.

**Timeline to Decision:**
- **Week 1:** Gather data, consult legal counsel, brief tribal leadership
- **Week 2:** File regulatory appeal if recommended by counsel
- **Week 4:** Financial viability decision (continue/optimize vs. exit)
- **Month 3:** Assess regulatory appeal progress and adjust strategy
